feel so uninteresting and hate people who are so knowledgeable in many topics,people arent an infinite void of knowledge and wisdom everyone knows something that you do not and you know lot of things that someone else doesnt know think you feel as if the things youre knowledgeable about are boring in reality some people might be fascinated in you may know more than some people about life careers management etc you know things that other people do not ve met tons of people who are confident about what theyre telling me only to find out eventually they were spewing nonsense some people lie to make themselves look better you have the self confidence to not need to do that you need to remember that you are not useless dying would leave hole in the fabric of time you have value and you are loved

how to get over the grief that there are so many people ll never get to meet or be friends with,had to get kind of spiritual about it these people might be really cool but the chances of you meeting the awesome people you already know are so small like to redirect that energy into appreciating them and letting them know appreciate them in terms of the spiritual bit kind of adopted the idea of im going to meet and become close to the people meant to and not meant to be acquainted with everyone that like to be

regular check in post plus reminder about the no activism rule,one of the hardest things for me has been realizing that when people say you can talk to me here for you they generally don mean it friend thought was close to gave me that spiel and when opened up to her about how was feeling she immediately recoiled and said you need to talk to professional not your therapist she said it as if had talked to her against her will when she was the one who repeatedly invited me to open up and declined at first because didn want to bother her know she not my therapist know that no one owes me anything wasn looking for her or anyone else to fix my problems or even offer advice all wanted was for someone to listen to me and maybe try to empathize it would ve meant the world to me just to express my feelings to someone and hear them say that sounds hard sorry you re dealing with that instead of lecturing me thought she was willing to listen in the same way that listened to her in the past don know what keep doing wrong think the best option is never to open up to anyone

being an adult feels scary,don think this feeling ever really leaves you or at least it hasn me and not far off but did find that it fades over time had to focus my energy into one part of myself or my life until felt happy with it and then branch out one area at time until got happier and more comfortable in my own skin don believe this is one size fits all solution but had success with it over time and maybe you would too but it starts with you looking at yourself and asking what do really care about
wish died when was,those counselors are not doing their due diligence depression normally only gets worse with time if not acted upon if you had the perfect job do you think things would feel better for you across the board or do you think it goes deeper than that to something like cyclical dark thinking identity troubles not knowing who you are etc past trauma or something else

do you ever get tired of not being happy,to be honest can relate to lot of things you just said the people and their cowardly behaviour how annoying they are and how much actually people care about you the bad is that am tired of not being happy but if start somewhere to go to the point where get better or happy kinda think of all these sad things actually and some bad seed in me reminds me that theres nothing to be happy about and then feel like have to be sad and depressed dont know why although hold on we should all be grateful that we get to die one day sorry not very optimistic take but please hold on and take care

hate fucking everything about myself,useless no skills no accomplishments how long was the longest time you tried to get good at something true skill can take years to foment stupid is this due to mind fog where you cant concentrate or remember or more problem of understanding material due to holes in basic knowledge stutter shy anxiety suspect this is likely due to cognitive pain from the depression making you overthink fear judgement fear exposure of how you feel about yourself or something similar to that have you had any good success finding the origin point of where the depression is coming from bud it can be obvious in some instances but there are many people myself included who had roots that were completely hidden until after tons of introspection and research

got called loner by my colleague today,loner can be compliment but your colleague is an ass nonetheless
im in loveeee,don think he would have put in the effort just to play with you not sure how old you are but people come and go and though there isn the one it usually takes minute to find solid match toss the whole undeserving of love mentality if you haven committed any terrible crimes you deserve love and you ll find it not to sound like self help guru but know you re bad ass and know that you re not alone edit usually so much better with your and you re my bad
went to therapy for depression therapist wouldnt stop insisting was closeted lesbian,literally just block him weirdo if you say you arent attracted to girls then its more than likely true and even if you are its not his place or his business to try and tell you that you are if you say no therapy is choice and its up to you if you want to go to another therapist but would heavily reccomend blocking him and not even giving him the time of day
why can just be loved,went through the same thing dude an ex of mine just broke up one day and told me he didn love me anymore out of nowhere cried and cried for months wondering what wrong with me thought was hopeless and unloveable but suddenly stopped thinking about him stopped stalking him on social media suddenly they were nothing to me and think my academic load was one of the things that helped me forget about him was too anxious and stressed out about failing my classes that just kept my heartbreak in box somewhere in my brain and eventually forgot about it we all want to be loved being loved is wonderful thing promise you that you ll find someone better soon and you ll forget about her it ll take time to get over the pain but you will promise we re here for you
whenever someone is upset with me want to die,get like this my brain just assumes people are mad at me for the slightest little thing too the downward spiral is more falling straight down hole because see the relationships falling apart theyll never talk to me again and ll die alone and convince myself life isnt worth living if thats the case very exhausting
really want affection but nobody can give what want,know how you feel is there chance to get back together if not then the more you remember her with regret and longing instead of reframing the memories as nostalgia or appreciation the deeper this is going to get no attack or judgement meant btw ve been through this several times is the introversion big part of why its hard to meet others or is work the bigger issue do you think

people think simple minded and lazy,know what you mean have you had any success in confronting the source of this anxiety thoughts situations etc either with professional or on your own it was bad for me for years too
such fucking hypocrite,pushing away is very common response when it comes to depression it is just one of many self destructive responses and you dont have to feel bad about it what matters is recognizing it as something you want to improve and start to focus on it more it can be difficult you may feel like burden to the person trying to get close but this isnt something that you have to suffer through alone do your best to accept the help when people offer it make sure to be appreciative but try to accept it rather than declining you may see an improvement for both of you
living for other people can anyone relate any advice,the medical profession is brutal went into the trades and honestly feel like its saved my life few times found something that better than most people at doing its the only area of my life that dont hate myself over plus the money is above average easier said than done to find something that you feel confident doing much less something you enjoy to some degree but at you should try jobs year see what you actually like this is your whole life youre trying to figure out if you pick high stress job you felt pressured to pursue it could literally be the death of you
let help one another,just went on and off of my baby mg dose of sertraline bc was feeling low and then things got so much worse after about week back on it trying to pull it together find things that spark joy but things have been feeling pretty lonely lately thanks for your post and the reminders self care is hard but self care is important
some asshole messaged me on here asking me what sucked from my previous post suck,what assholes ask for sexual favors on depresion forum just dont get it
sertraline mg and worsening headaches,from what understand it not the best idea to go right back to the dose you were on before tapering know had to build up to mg before eventually tapered off sertraline rule of thumb is to start on lower dose even if you were on higher one because these are meant to affect your brain kind of how person who gets out of rehab and goes back to drugs is more likely to overdose by trying the amount they used before but the brain has adjusted to not using that much and isn used to it overdose definitely talk to your doctor about it you should always talk about problematic symptoms and you might want to mention that you didn get these before and that pain meds aren working

invisible to many people,story of my fucking life it been this way since was born was the one not taken seriously nor noticed in my family since day one and most likely thanks to them ve grown accustomed to making myself invisible to everyone around me no one will notice shit if was ever planning to kill myself know that literally no one would be able to save me because they wouldn notice the signs nor check up on me deep down think that people like us are such force it takes lot of power to get used to the fact that you re invisible because of that you start doing so many things on your own that most people aren even half capable of it rather called being misfit and misfits are basically burst of skills due to their invisibleness we re just disguised geniuses

want more life,feel the same as you spent my college years working and studying so much to the point that had almost no social life college was not the amazing experience that thought it would be was going to travel this year but then covid decided to introduce himself
never thought my life would be where it is now,hey there sorry you are going through all of that and feel that way but as someone on the somewhat opposite end of things wanted to share my perspective almost as well my th is just over month from now unmarried with no kids have degree and good job and if you were looking at me on social media you would think my life is awesome but the thing is social media only shows what let it show in reality ve suffered from depression since was and no amount of freedom or professional achievement changes that when loneliness and depression hit me they hit me hard and usually alone in my apartment to deal with it being chronically single hurts honestly it like just can quite figure it out in that part of my life and it leaves me feeling empty despite the accomplishments on paper human connection is probably the most valuable thing anyone can have and without it there is definite void so while the home buying people and happy couples flood social media with photos of those happy moments remember that you aren seeing the argument that happened an hour later or the other struggles people face hope that things get better for you and your family take care

brain injury left me in depression help,knew someone who had similar situation and it took some months before they felt little like themselves again the school part especially perhaps there are small things you can do to rebuild start talking to one person bit and expand from there for school perhaps do couple extra study questions to retrain your mind believe in you open to talking more tell me about yourself
never leaving this place,hear you what helped me with overcoming inhibitions is starting small sometimes we bite off more than we can chew that is normal we have to adjust our aims and slowly expand the comfort zone then we can celebrate the small wins and build from there even responding to this comment is social win then maybe next time you can do something bigger once the ball is rolling we pick up momentum believe in you you got this admire your effort am here to talk
at the end of my wire staring right into death,that sounds really tough what you re going through my mother was the same in some ways in that when she was stressed it seemed like everyone else had to feel bad the verbal and emotional abuse is going to effect your self esteem self confidence and mental health you re only you shouldn be feeling like this feel for you if you had some money do you think you could manage moving out
do not know what the is wrong with me,hear you dont think anything is wrong with you this might just be natural response of the mind to high stress environment the good news is we can condition ourselves slowly at first to make the changes you are interested in is there small place you can start something easy small win that can be built on
being an adult is too hard and cant deal with it wanna jump,calm down deep breaths being too negative its part of life to grow take responsibility of ones own life thing is thinking all ur problems as whole rather than one at time that is why getting overwhelmed yes money is important in life yes it is tough out there but rather than feeling like playing losing game why dont think of it as an experience like gaining perspective in life everything depends on our perspective why dont think of ways that will help earn more money some side job or something online job

drinking to numb the pain,drinking for pain tbh it makes you dependant and it sucks drinking in itself is something havent yet experienced but know lot about it and dont plan on drinking for pain numbing good idea is to only drink to feel happier than you already do not when you feel like shit however not your mom you do you simply giving my input
how can get my depressed ex back miss him so much and want to support him in the best way can but he pushed me out and fear for his safety as he is turning to alcohol and drugs as manner of coping,wow this is rough you can only help someone who wants to be helped though especially in situation like this see you care lot about him so perhaps just reach out be straight and lay out your feelings like you did here have an honest conversation and go from there think you both might be at different places when it comes to understanding the situation so if you can bridge that gap you can make an informed decision
just want to cry and then jump out of the window,ve read each word if your story and feel you it really sucks to have worked hard for romantic relationship to ignite and all of sudden you get honest with her and everything falls into pieces youve done nothing wrong all you did was confess she probably didnt understand how heartbroken you were after all this and thought that it would clearly be ok to move on and offer you job dont look at your window for too long let it all out and when youre ready get busy to forget about her saying go to work or whatever just keep your mind off of her play video games or watch movie hope understood your feelings

feeling lost any advice would help alot,hey man am also somebody who ended up moving back home with their parents and feeling down because like you said felt like such failure this was some time ago so am able to reflect back ll tell you that moved back at so youre still in your your adult life is just beginning really so dont fret that youre past your prime or whatever society tells you what success is lets take look at your suffering right now you have fear pain of feeling like failure because of this belief its causing you great pain there are ways to go about this either you move out and find way on your own or accept the fact that youre living with your parents and adjust your view of what success is your view of success and unsuccess of what is good and bad is causing your pain lets say moving out is not an option and therefore you must stay then lets take look at your belief that moving back with your parents is sign of failure this idea of moving home with your parents is something you have decided to attach your own belief systems to its choice so believe that you need to accept the situation for what it is and remove that judgement you have created with it dont think of it as success or failure simply look at it as it is moving back home remove all personal judgement on that act think most people will recognise that this post covid world is something no one has ever dealt with look back at living with my parents as positive even though at the time struggled like you did with my own thoughts of what should be achieving at the time but what remember most was reconnecting with my parents and noticing that they were getting much older and that my time with them can be seen as positive if shifted my view something that caused me great pain became an appreciation of spending time with my loved ones so think you need to accept that your success will look different from what the world tells you and that you accept that things will look and happen differently but also have belief in yourself that through hard work and dedication you can achieve your goals hope this helps

don know what to do,if you opened up to your parents about this wouldnt expect them to be very surprised finding out about that your parents are getting division is something traumatic for some people although havent personally been through such an event they might not understand how depression might stay in you for longer unless theyve been through it theirselves if youve found some new friends thats great try to get closer with at least one of them and maybe you can then safely discuss what youre going through together it will get better you just have to stay open minded with positive mindset even though it might seem difficult or near impossible ve been through depression myself so trust me not talking bullshit take care

my boyfriend got upset on depressive episode,don you blame yourself at all all you did was acknowledge the patterns can confirm as depressed person it better to know rather then have emotions you don understand he should get help it not your responsibility to make him happy and he need to understand that all can do is support thinks maybe he in denial and tbh in this society it harder for men who aren allowed to expressed their state of mind it shitty yes however the reason think he was upset is because this is only based on my personal experience but when someone acknowledges fault in you you think that person doesn want or accept you anymore and if you already dislike yourself it amplified or it the facts that being depressed often leads to isolation and nobody want to be around sad people we know that and imagin the person you love the most can be around you when your sad it painful for both parties hope guys figure it out sending love

lonely and afraid,had the same thing happen from my parents and my entire friend circle everything went to hell at the same time at and it took long time to pick the pieces back up no longer in regular contact with any of my parents except one who apologized changed their ways and is all about the love now or those friends the bright side is that no longer need to walk on eggshells or prop up relationships that others dont care for and can better choose my social links living situation and work hope you have some good plans for who you want to be what you want to do and where youre going from here forward bud its rough spot youre in know very well
does depression cause lack of empathy for others like this,its common to not be able to empathize with others with or without depression but when youre in the thick of your own troubles its even easier to lose sight of the pain of others as well hope youre on good track to identifying the root of this pain to target it more effectively bud
wish that the few people know would just invite me out to something just once,that shitty feeling and honestly know exactly what that like here how approach these situations simply ask to be included next time but don say it way that shames them hey that sounds like fun next time you guys do something like that shoot me text
it seems like my only option,please take care of yourself thats the first step to becoming reach out to someone close to you or even charity wish you all the best
dont want to do this anymore,assure you that it may not seem like it is worth it now but this moment is just the rain before the rainbow ending your life is not worth it please know that it is okay to have these thoughts but please dont act upon them
im thinking of killing myself and cant get help,you re not dramatic promise you that your feelings are valid and should be taken seriously ve felt the same way as you feel that way but little part of me knows that this is valid people care our minds like to think the worst of life it job is to keep us alive not happy parents often don understand my dad didn for years just last month tho he finally became supportive know it tough but try to find light even if it small anything works
hope ll see her again,doubt they tell you she there but you might be able to just ask them to pass along your contact info to her
want someone to notice,hey ve never really dealt with or had friends who ve questioned their sexuality so apologize if say anything ignorant or whatever how exactly does you being with your girlfriend affect you does it always make you feel bad more than good maybe it not her but maybe you should end things if you really feel it not the right thing it might hurt her some but it also hurting you now atleast from what read and please know there is no one to blame she doesn understand probably because she never dealt with depression and you can really control your feelings just trying to help but do what best for you and don think it selfish you should be priority to yourself because you matter and your feelings are valid
helpless and alone,am so sorry you feel this way however you are not alone there are many of us on here that feel similar feelings and use this to vent as well as to share stories and support each other let it out we don judge here
should have grown up now am years old with no direction in life and no clear decisions,this really resonated with me actually have someone very dear to me who has been and is continuing to make many of the same life choices and hes finally coming to light about everything and its consequences and its affecting him in similar ways its affecting you basically hes preventing himself from moving forward partially because he doesnt know how or doesnt have the confidence in himself to cant move forward due to anxiety and depression that acts as leeway and instigator for lot of his decisions that are only powered by consequences of previously ill made choices hes been stuck with the same lifestyle mindset for so long that its hard to snap out of it especially bc he has hobbies anime manga video games and pokemon that he throws himself into as distraction to evade confronting or doing things that matter in his life like work or basic upkeep etc and yes like yours his mother and father does lot for him as if he has no hands or brain even though he is ridiculously smart gonna tell you straight up that youre still young and you very much have full life ahead of you do feel that you are overwhelming yourself by combining the choices you have made in the past present and the regret on top of it is just killing ya it also sounds like you are or are developing anxiety and depression that is consistently result of causation by your life regrets basically you have lot of mental baggage in your head space recommend seeking professional help for your anxiety depression and also to aid sorting through your thoughts and how you think about yourself and your life completely separate from your mental health in order to get into the habit of fulfillment make small goals for yourself and achieve those goals little by little so you can maintain the feeling of positive reinforcement for diligent work small goals can be as little as learning new recipe running mile helping friend commit yourself to succeeding small responsibilities so you can do bigger ones and instead of letting regret be the reason why you have stopped living your life let it be the driving factor as to why you will turn your life around you feel bad that your mom has taken care of you all this time and now theyre too old use your love for her to take care of her and better yet take care of yourself it sounds like you are your biggest limiter at the moment wish you best of luck
the suffering if you live withe your parents,im in the same boat with you maybe find different ways to let the emotions out like through art crocheting sports etc mean im not saying dont ever cry because you should sometimes bottling it all up is really bad trust me
my girlfriend cuts her wrist,yeah mean you arent therapist this woman obviously has some problems and you wont be able to give her the help she needs all can say is be bit selfish focus on your own health because thats all you can do talk to her tell her exactly what you said here be honest but also would suggest bringing it back to friend level
can anyone help me,what kinds of intrusive thoughts are they are they in the first or second person do they speak generally or specifically do you recognize the voice theyre in ve had lots of experience with this darkness from years of previous suicidal depression and crippling social anxiety
worthless everyone worthless,agree absolutely hate it when all people say is feel better it means nothing but at the same time want people to feel better it weird youre not just post though think everybody is somebody in that they feel their own things and what not but you see so many people everyday and not even of them will mean anything to you and we wont mean anything to them in that sense we are all nothing
miss my fiancé,you are an intelligent talented and amazing person hope that your weekend is as breathtaking and beautiful as you are
ve probably been depressed for the majority of the past years,not gonna lie to you can relate my heart was made for love desire that loving touch from someone you love however my past refuses to let me my father betrayed my trust over and over and now refuse to give or receive hugs ve been getting better hugs here and there but it still is hard when alone and see myself it hurts to know like an empty shell of the happy child once was want you to do something some random on the internet weird but listen please love yourself if you cant love yourself then you cant learn how to love others truly wont lie still am working on it but it doesnt mean cant pass on this advice rooting for ya
feel like there are zero things to enjoy anymore,fucking hate politics completely understand what youre feeling
fuck holidays,totally with you here today sucks and the next month straight will suck too hate my family they hate me have no significant other my only friend is states away my very best friend and reason for living my cat passed away in ever since then ve had legit nothing and also go on social media to see everyone celebrate and flaunting what don have and probably will never have fuck holidays

absolutely broken,best thing you can do is accept its over and just move on don waste any time on it sure wish would ve done that
why aren my medications working,you could try maois tranylcypromine as they are often useful for treatment resistant depression take moclobemide which is an reversible maoi so no dietary restrictions are needed but it does not seem to work as good as irreversible maois for some people for me it works pretty well though
don get to close it dark inside,its good to share how you feel sometimes though bottling it up is never good idea
others peoples sadness is killing me,because nobody wants to be truly there for someone else its all about personal gain no quality relationships no quality society
when you realize you re just an npc in someone else world,this is my opinion so take it with grain of salt majority of human beings are side characters from the first person perspective of any given individual for example pre covid times when walk through crowded hallway at college the people walking past me are npc side characters fillers from my perspective my close friends are deuteragonists and the protagonist from your perspective just faceless npc from reddit and you are the protagonist for the majority of humans thinking of yourself as the protagonist of other peoples lives rather than just your own life is not very realistic not everyone can be super edit edited my comment
time heals they say,honestly the same way people always tell me shit like that imo beyond help as in verbal help hate getting unsolicited advice and being told stupid cliche bullshit like love yourself and youll find the one without considering themselves to do the deed like come on is hug or holding my hand too fucking hard for you assholes you guys are contributing to my negative thoughts
can get out of bed,am still struggin with this after years its hard some times fall asleep when its noon and wake up when its dark and then will feel even worse and so on
my family and friends want to help me with my depression what are some ways they can do this,be there for you to talk when you need it give lotsa hugs be shoulder to cry on ect
this world is shit place to live,yeah is write off for sure thats just the facts of life for planet earth right now also very low atm as sure alot of depressed people are and probably even people who are usually not depressed are getting depressed just due to global situation but like always when get overwhelmed find have to take step back and take things one step at time no future plans just one step at time
st johns wort effects experiences eyesight,in my experience say dont waste your time used it and it did absolutely nothing unless you think you can fall for the plecebo effect but im speaking for myself and give it thumbs down
happy thanksgiving,know that thanksgiving isnt for me but thanks
forcing myself to do things makes me hate them doing nothing makes me hate myself,dont have any advice or solution but can relate everything feels like its chore even things that are supposed to be fun also go on walk every day to try to feel better it did kind of seem to help for little while but now my depression has set back in and have to make myself go dont enjoy it nearly as much as used to the only thing really want to do is sleep
holidays are probably worse than normal days,sorry friend know these feelings you speak of hope you can find little calm during all the holiday chaos and expectations
lost soul near the sea,do you still have the good free time and freedom with your new work to meet people friend or dating or is it more about not being able to make the connection in the first place
cutting ties,why does hearing name make you want to kill yourself bud what is it about the other gender that makes it feel like you should be there instead to the point that death seems like viable alternative
just want someone to talk with,why not let them know how you feel if they open up to you they should be fine with the reverse and if they arent then youll know you deserve better friends and can learn not to open up to family anymore otherwise if youre not up to sharing with them would you be up to confronting and assailing the root of your pain on your own and have friends and family be an oasis of rest from the private war thats what did when it was clear that my werent equipped to offer direct help and it worked well for me
wonder what its like to feel love,same as it feels for depression it never lives up to narrative and you hype it up more dreaming about the story verse the actual feeling
will benadryl vodka get me dead,depends on how much you drink take take benadryl or two while after drinking moderately all the time and perfectly fine
how and when do you tell your parents you are depressed,when you feel like it there no adequate time but if you know they re gonna be supportive the sooner the better tell them how you re feeling as thoroughly as possible tell them your symptoms explain to them that it hard part of your life to ignore and you like to seek help before it worsens fuck if your family knows this isn anything to be embarrassed by it an actual illness
can find the energy to cope with being at work,is it the work itself thats problem or more that its resting atop other deeper troubles do you think

social media are the worst thing ever,wouldn read too much into it no one will want to show the things that hurt them makes them insecure things might look perfect but you don know the bad
im jeleous of the old generation,people were more occupied and busy envy that tbh
why do feel this way,haven been diagnosed but ve dealt with derealization which is pretty much what you described dissociation with everything around you and not just that your depression seems to be getting worse maybe you should check out subreddit for it and talk to people there or your family and psychiatrist for both dissociation and depression please note derealization is nothing to be too terrified of though it lot more common with people with anxiety and depression sometimes people can experience symptoms of it from time to time it all really depends but everything you re feeling is normal many other people have felt and dealt with the same things

had this horrible thought that could take down the most resilient person with paragraph of how view the world because mental illness is form of reality it can be contagious but in the end its the resilient ones we need they need us in more ways then we know,thank you for sharing will ponder this some more
anyone else alone with no turkey,yup most of the world doesn celebrate thanksgiving yesterday was thursday for me and billions of others

how are you feeling today are you hungry are you angry are you sad,im doing ok kind of lost in what the next step in life is but im hanging on how are you
know it stupid and illogical to worry about my girlfriend boss flirting with her but it seems to have depressed the hell out of me,first off let me say that if she is still with you and has let you know that his flirting is making her uncomfortable then clearly she has no interest in him shes actually repulsed by him and his advances and is actively choosing to stay with you you think hes better than you because of his money career social skills etc because of this it makes no sense to you that she would choose you but the fact that she has already made her choice she actively prefers you shows that theres more important value in you that youre not seeing but she is you are basing your worth on these measurements of success but she isnt youre insecure about that fact that this guy not much older than you is running business is rich has nice cars and is very socially confident heres the thing he was most likely born into that the vast majority of ceos bosses and rich guys come from rich families that can afford to send their kids to the best schools and give them hundreds of thousands of dollars to start up their own business of course hes more socially confident than you the world was built for him and hes had massive red carpet laid out for him from birth do not blame yourself for living in precarious labour market on minimum wage when the system you live in is designed to be like this why do you think depression and anxiety has been spiking in recent decades youre in the same situation as millions of people living on minimum wage and struggling to find jobs you are not alone and this is not your fault cant remember the exact figures but over the coronavirus lockdown something like million americans were facing eviction and millions have lost their jobs and healthcare is that the fault of each individual person simply not working hard enough or being smart enough unless youre born into rich family or fall into exceptional circumstances genius iq winning the lottery going viral as musical artist minimum wage work slow graduation precarious work conditions and difficulty in finding jobs is the norm nowadays you dont need money marketable skills or other arbitrary measurements of success to define your self worth both because its not your fault and because it doesnt make you more valuable human being evidenced by your girlfriend preferring you over the boss its good to have those things so that you can survive but it doesnt matter on human level would you think the rich bankers responsible for the crash are more valuable than you your girlfriend and your family would you drop your girlfriend for elon musk theyre ultra rich billionaires who got into extremely high paying jobs from youth and are extremely self confident so arent they better than you and everyone you care about think of anyone you really care about did you like them for their money would you care about them more if they were the ceo of multi billion dollar company your girlfriend has already been given the option between some prick boss who drives nice cars and harasses his employees and you she has already chosen you you need to stop letting your parasitic internal self loathing from getting in the way of reality and the reality is that people love and care about you and their judgement is lot more trustworthy than yours because you see yourself through this constant ugly filter that is obviously false because she doesnt see you through it if she did she would have left you by now or never had been with you in the first place guess the next step is to know why she chooses you its not money or cars so what is it what does she say she likes about you if you dont know then talk to her and find out why she cares about you so much not saying get her to write list or answer direct questions just figure out why she loves you then make sure you trust her judgement recognize the tricks that the self loathing parasite will use to being you down and tell them to fuck off she wouldnt like you if she really knew you shes just saying that to make you feel better about yourself shell change her mind and leave you for the boss eventually you say you trust her so trust her over the internal parasite that wants to destroy you and your self image also dont know you but given the choice would much rather hang out with than the boss say what you will about yourself but at least you dont sexually harass your employees and make them feel uncomfortable doesnt seem very socially skillful to me recommend this always revisit it when need boost the knowledge provided has shown me where my self worth truly lays that failures of my environment are not failures of me and that millions or tens of millions of people are struggling just like us hope this helps writing mostly from my own experience how have beaten lot of my depression still battle but winning for the first time in my life good luck
things got worse,sorry about your friend force yourself to eat something decent if you haven then try to do some exercise even just pushups or situps it won make you happy but it can take the edge off the pain and make things more tolerable
fucking done with this world,understand your perspective agree altruism is never pure or absolute even for the mother teresas of this world no one absoslutely no one is completely selfless were all motivated by something internal or external yes some focus less on the greater good than others but were all still motivated by our personal desires we do good because it makes us feel good if it didnt feel good we wouldnt do good izey victoria odiase
hi new and need guidance,wouldnt say its being dramatic in the slightest if you feel it necessary ve made certain decisions to protect myself from the darker moments knew would come when was able to think clearly enough to see the threat could become to myself
did something good for once,your steps dont need to be big they just need to be on the right direction
tell me why shouldnt shoot myself or will,in no position to list reasons not to end it feel similar most days sadly ve spent so much time convincing myself that should have forgotten how to convince myself not would like to know what happens both in my possible future and after life so that doesnt help would like to change something for the better and have little list of things dont want to see again honestly dont because it is easier to continue one more day finding the perfect method is just too much effort anything less than perfect is more likely to make my life even worse wish could give an answer suggest give it little longer see where this is going
broke my own number rule don share music with people who aren family,currently working on associating new memories with the songs used to love but it gonna take time yes it is but this is the right path to take there was an album my ex and loved listening to together it is still one of my all time favorite albums it hurt lot to listen to that album after we broke up but the music meant more to me than her cheating ass ever did time heals all wounds it has been over years since that breakup but goddamn love that music
ve struggled with depression more than half of my life but ve learned to deal with it accept the beauty of it,wow needed to hear this your post gave me hope and encouragement don know what else to say other than me learning about this thankful for someone like you to put depression in another perspective this is beautiful hope you have wonderful day and happy thanksgiving much love
fuck university,paper due the day after thanksgiving is bs
dont enjoy life,recommend reading perhaps bit about stoicism and existentialism there is great youtube channel pursuit of wonder that does great overviews of these subjects that are worth checking out but when it boils down to it there is no cosmic point to anything really therefore you ought to make your own you said you play or atleast used to video games inherently there is no point what so ever to playing video games besides some sort of entertainment perhaps life is not to different just random sequence of event that you have the pleasure to witness and be part of but am also just twat on the internet
judged for eating lot on thanksgiving,keep telling yourself that that the food was made to eat that thanksgiving is literally about eating that everyone eats on thanksgiving that there supposed to be lot food on your plate don let anyone tell you otherwise because these are facts over invalid and hypocritical opinions sorry you had to spend your dinner listening to that but know you did nothing wrong
anyone feel vulnerable being depressed in society,yep with you being depressive introvert suck
after almost two years medication and therapy free going back to therapy now can help but feel like failure,understand completely did the previous therapy help you to understand identify confront and replace dark thinking when it didnt match reality or wellness or was it more about venting and releasing do you think never had much success with venting talk group therapy for my suicidal depression
sometimes the only thing keeping me alive is the sound of my cat heartbeat and purr,sorry to hear this dude although will say one thing your cats purr is confirmation of the fact that even at your lowest your very presence and existence can mean so much to those who know you similarly am struggling to want to remain alive but we need to hold on to reminders such as you gave that even in our darkest moments we bring others light send you much love as we fight this fight together my friend
tired of being alone tired of being scared to trust talk to someone tired of crying tired of the pain tired of being tired,feel you life can be so draining it fucking sucks when you reach out to the people who you think are your friends and all they say is that its just phase and itll pass ve been severely depressed for about years now and still waiting for this shit to pass they dont even want to hang out because apparently buzzkill when share my view ugh so over telling this shit to anyone tbh just dont act like you miss me when rotting in the ground sorry didnt mean to make this about me just started writing and it didnt stop all meant to say was that know what you feel like and its way too complicated to put it into words just know that if was with you would give you hug okay
am supposed to be sad all the time,no you have depression go to psychiatrist

thanksgiving,hear you been there covid probably makes it worse wasn ready to hear it right away but there are so many girls out there ones that are better for you it rough getting past the initial heartbreak but there is lot out here for you brother treat it as learning opportunity and come back better version of yourself your future relationship will thank you for it
tired of feeling awful want to change but don know how,think the hardest thing about what you are feeling is that those feelings continue to make us feel down and hard on ourselves too struggle with depression and anxiety used to google how to change this or that or what hobby or distraction could do to bring me out of my depressive thought process for myself the worst part is the belief that stupid and not where wish was mentally spent years finding bad habits to change how felt about myself in moment for the last year ve seen therapist got lucky and found someone clicked with and felt comfortable opening up to avoided therapy for so long but it has helped me make better sense of the things you mention here there isnt an easy answer to our problems but having someone walk me through my own thought process and understand myself better has allowed me to find some comfort therapy can be expensive but if there is way you can find professional to talk to think it is worth shot know my answer isnt perfect and only reflects what has helped me but it has helped me to the point that can look forward and feel more positive about myself and life
on my final leg,had severe depression and anxiety from to so get your head space atm it sucks but the fact youre writing this is positive sign to be honest that said seeing psychologist not psychiatrist very different things should be priority you cannot trust your own mind right now and if there is the capacity to take time off work using personal or holiday leave perhaps consider that but in conjunction with seeking expert medical advice
wish had partner or at least best friend,me too but everytime meet someone like push them away and then feel lonely again
cowards suicide how to choose to live,can imagine how painful this all would have been all can do is say that truly hope that it gets beter and send virtual hug

can tell what feel anymore advice,you stated the reasons you feel the way you do going to give it to you straight your reasons sound selfish if you need to take break tell him see how he feels use the time apart to see therapist or something it doesnt have to be permanent sorry if sound little harsh but if were in his shoes would be quite irritated if you just sat on the fence about how youre feeling without sharing
heart got shattered on tgiving eve pls say something nice,don give up on yourself just because he didn pursue the relationship maybe he with someone maybe he just needs time apart either way keep your head up

want to kill myself,feel like sometimes people have this urge to end it all due the the false idea that one is suppose to be happy all the time which is not really the case this might not sound like the usual just be happy or look on the bright side sorta advice or whatever but do understand where youre comming from having been there myself but honestly mate what got me out of the suicidal rut and this might just have worked for me is not focusing on being happy per se try just being the best human you can be and try making the small piece of space that surrounds you little better highly recommend throughly listing to this is water by david foster wallace it has personally helped me fair bit although this being said do not know you or what youre trails and tribulations have been or currently are so might be completely wrong so you know dont listen to idiot on the internet
pregnancy depression,be with her talk with her if she cry hug her talk about the baby talk about show you and her could watch

at this point ve lost my will to do anything,have so much to do yet come back into my room with nothing to do all do is waste time during the day and wait until night so can sleep or do things have lots of work to do but my motivator is that ll fail the semester if don finish it and it works don expect yourself to do so much if you can try little bit at time
think its time to say goodbye,my family used to be the same but its not worth killing yourself depression isnt something that can magicaly go away and you have long road ahead im so sorry am sorry that they cant look you in the face and remind you its not your fault its not your fault that you feel this way and these negative agressive thoughts they arent you youre getting older now thingsnmay seem like they have gotten worse but they havent its always been this way but as you age you open youre eyes more the that you wanted to ignore as child if things are getting to point you feel this way would suggest calling the authorities its okay to be scared and not know what to do maybe speak with some adults you trust first and have them help you youre not wrong for wanting it better hope you know that may not know you personally but damn know what every word you just said feels like there is whole bunch of us out there and guess what im now its long fight even after youre gone from them but promise when say it isnt worth ending it at you have so many mistakes to make people to laugh with and imprints to make in others lives and although it may not seem like any of its true right now please just give it chance let the idea sit with you youre worth more then how they treat you and the way they are isnt your fault youre stronger than them thats why it hurts so much more for you the words and actions flow like water for them because they cant handle the effort the strength it takes to think befoe acting all this pain you feel is because youre strong enough to handle it so many years so many you felt this way dont deny yourself your strength because of them
talk is cheap actions prove that unwanted and alone,ultimately it up to you whether or not you accept or believe other people advice for what it worth think that you deserve to be able to reach out and get the help you need most of the people aren on this subreddit because of savior complex but because they feel exactly the same way you feel something in that helps me occasionally is looking at some of the people who feel the exact same as me they all seem like people who don deserve all of the hate they give themselves and if they don deserve it maybe don either even if this comment won help hope that you ll be alright
finally searched some help,hey congratulations on taking those steps so sorry you ve gone through so much recently

just question about note,think you should write some kind words for them and prepare everything for the teacher that replaces you maybe you could also have colleague replacing you and what also would be helpful when your school is telling them about mental health issues and suicide it helps to make them understand your suicide later it is nice to know that you are worried teacher about your students they like you for sure
hi dae find that their depression makes them think irrationally and say things they dont mean,think see what you mean little similar in that really struggle to articulate things properly when put on the spot so end up saying the words that seem to fall into place in my head even if it isnt really what trying to convey as for the irrationality think it is common symptom of depression but it probably isnt helped by the stress of abuse just remember you dont have to be with him forever obviously know nothing of your family situation other than from this post but if you are in an abusive relationship then that is no way healthy not really sure what you can do to manage it other than trying to focus on you and maybe talking to someone but have no doubt that the abuse is exacerbating it
dont even know anymore,there are always options for younger person what are your interests find community through your interests if possible pandemic is messing with those options right now but try to connect with like minded people it is hard know
am depressed and school is factor in it,don let it be excuse to drive you deeper tho acknowledging it and finding solutions will give you better results than letting it get to and not doing anything like to take shower and clean my room makes that day feel good and then if feel bad tmrow clean my room lol but more and just force my self to be productive if you re struggling hard in math there still teachers that can assist you even if it online

ve failed my first semester,first of all as teacher can confidently tell you that your mental health is more important than semester of school you can make up credits later and in the course of your lifetime its really not going to matter as much as the oh you need to graduate right away and go straight to college mentality of our society wants you to believe you can retake class but you cant un kill yourself theres lot more to you than made up grade someone assigns you know the side effects of ssris are awful but they improve immensely after week or you need to give it time to settle in your body almost gave up on mine after the first couple days when it made me nauseous unable to sleep and felt like my brain was crackling idk how else to describe it but stuck with it for few days longer and it got better after that my suicidal thoughts definitely started decreasing hang in there

having someone isn everything,part of having people in your life is to be able to share the bad moments not just the good if you are hiding the pain and depression away from your family and friends than you are no less alone than the people yearning for friends and relationships
just don know why try anymore,before you do that is there anything cool want to do before that like robbing gas station or something anything is better than losing you
hard time of year,my doctors and my girlfriend tell me just need to keep trying that not trying hard enough that right there not trying hard enough is very slippery slope if you start believing that even though youre giving it your best shot you will inevitably become discouraged which is absolutely horrible however need to keep trying is something you need to tell yourself not the other way around live by it if you can the strongest people are the most resilient and persevered this is how you fight you keep trying over and over again like some kind of pest to your depression who wont give up can only imagine this is lot for you to deal with and in some ways share similar experience but hope this helps little

faking it at work,seek medical help bro dont let this evolve into snowball rooting for your best recovery
have depression but am scared of the meds,you shouldnt be on meds forever if this isnt genetic or physical problem so theres less to worry about that if you think it came from your parents and childhood situation it might be more cognitive issue have you considered therapy especially cognitive therapy it might not just help with your anxiety about meds because you may not even have to take them but it seems more suitable to the roots of your pain bud
in pain most of the time,sorry youre in such pain if you need someone to talk to am here
for people taking antidepressants that work well with them when did you first realize that they were working or how did you feel,went for over years trying different antidepressants and never getting any positive results one gp last year just happened to offer fluoxetine as last resort and it actually worked had given up on anything pharmaceutical actually helping
we will neves be together again,you can live in the past relationships come and relationships fall apart did not handle breakups well but did manage to keep on going and found love again it takes to make relationship last and if one is not interested then it is doomed and you have to keep going forward someday you might find someone that truly loved you with all there heart and would walk thru fire for you that is the kind of relationship that last try to open yourself up to new people and focus on other things you hold dear to your heart time is the only thing that heals the wounds of being left behind hope things work out for you in the end and there are many people that is in your situation things will get better but only if you manage to look forward
how dealing with my depression,you go girl these look like great changes and its great youre taking care of yourself kinda worried me at first how long it was cause made checklists of stuff wanted to do differently and was hard on myself and set too many goals to achieve all of them but trying is the only way to know what youre capable of you can totally do it just be patient and dont be too hard on yourself
ve been feeling horrible lately today was told that use my depression as an excuse for the way that act this really hurt me it feels like no one cares or understands me,are you feeling better now after your posts thinking about things that make you happy is really good start also suggest other self care activities that could be having long hot bath shower watching relaxing youtube videos putting on funny movie anything that makes you feel good and cared for have you tried ringing any hotlines or anything as well
at roadblock,depression can happen to anyone even people with friends job etc its valid to feel that way regardless of circumstances and sorry to hear that you feel like your life is empty right now chronic pain is my mom and dad have dealt respectively with back pain and ankle pain for years my mom walks on her ankle for hour retail shifts comes home and lays ice on it while she lies down for the rest of the day dont know how she can stand it props to you for working jobs through your pain mental and physical used to work and would burn myself out sometimes dont think could do that without purpose behind it and being depressed before made that really hard some days for me when doubt myself but having good friends helped me decompress gave me something to look forward to and not self isolate why do you think you feel empty how did you end up with friends you have nothing in common with have hard time feeling valued if my relationships felt empty and lacked common ground dont know how the relationship with your guy is but someones still taken romantic interest in you better than my luck since covid started haha
trying to debate giving up,youve shown tremendous strength living as strongly as you have for not just years but decades that is utterly admirable are there resources available from the government charity groups or church that help with those particular chronic illnesses to hopefully ease the burden
tw need help desperately to help my fellow depressed best friend,for the best path towards wellness would highly recommend encouraging her to see professional or to try and put your heads together and see why shes doing it in the first place there could be many roots from past trauma to cyclical self hating thoughts genetic issues to brain chemistry but if you were more interested in being her rock and her oasis also recommend the normalcy path spend time with her talk with her make her laugh and smile cook go to the movies do what you can to provide her with the support she needs to come back from these dark days this is especially useful if shes seeing professional on her own then comes back to you where you have the best and most normal life waiting to offer to her it helps more than most know to have that oasis from personal experience with suicidal depression
is storey building tall enough,you may need time off to get help in my employer fired me for non performance my lawyer ate them alive arguing that the real reason was that my employer required us to log doctors when taking time off for medical appointments my doctor was psychologist and they feared that was going to file for stress leave which was on the path towards there was also no documented issues of non performance on my hr record net net got about months pay was able to spend the first three months dealing with my mental health and did end up finding decent job still suffer bouts of depression
having an attachment to childhood,want to hug you man felt the same way for the past couple of years now for starters years old who is sophomore in college however have the mindset on kid who doesnt know what to do what makes it worst is that see old highschool friends get into relationships or find new careers knowing their outcome while left blind and alone for my future it hurts sometimes wish was ten running around doing whatever without care in the world

rant about why think am depressed,sorry your mom is that way feel the same way with my dad he always like to make fun of me and mock me when am on the brink of suicide he always says over dramatic and not depressed and what he loves to do now is that because he going to late to early he always guilt trips me into me not wanting hangout with him and that am terrible son for not caring about him it also doesnt help that anytime my grade drops in college he gets very angry at me and that am worthless for failing class knowing damn well juggle classes lets not forget he likes to call me gay or wuss for not liking manly sports like fishing and theres also the always right and dont question my orders mentality sorry if ranted bit but in short my relationship with my dad feels forced and feel like cant share my opinions or feeling with him which sucks cause his only son
one of the hardest realities of getting older for me has been accepting that even though may treat others how would like to be treated those people do not have to do the same for me,unfortunately this is very common reality most people will only take advantage of your kindness and disappear when they have no further use for you but dont let this take away your will to help others this world needs more people that like you are good at hearth know its unfair heartbreaking and even tiring to have to deal with this over and over but if you keep being the amazing person you are you will eventually find people that will truly value you just dont lose hope on this good luck friend and thank you for being the way you are
my life is total failure,hi school is bad place while at the same time good has its pros and cons just like everything else but schools little bit shittier recommend just waiting till it ends and youll go to college or work etc was actually lonely most of my life or didnt care about getting friends one of the best ways to find friends is through same favorite activities try to find some online friends games social media etc in my opinion games are better but social media isnt that bad either just little harder and dont worry about your english its fine and understandable wish you luck and hold on just little
dont have to read this whole thing if you dont want to,hey dont end it dont end ut dont end it
who even cares,year old man know how you feel ve never been violated but my past is sordid one it is hard to talk to normal people about depression hard to talk about the fucking toiling futility of it but if it provides you any comfort know that people do care care others here care and nothing you do can change that be safe
lost motivation to lift weights,right now force yourself to keep doing it if you absolutely hate it after weeks say stop doing it its good if you keep going it even though you dont like it but if it comes to the point when it affects your mental health you should immediately stop the reason why think you should keep going is because you dont want to lose your gains weeks or months from now when youve lost some of your gains and want to get back to training youll be either really unmotivated to go again because you have to regain some of your gains though its easier to get your gains back because youve already had them or you take break from lifting for awhile not too long just long enough to feel like going again and not lose any of your gains choice is upto you best of luck
please help,hey you doing ok do you have places offline you could speak with people either in fun way like activity club or church or in serious way like therapist or doctor internet relationships never did much to make me feel better and in many ways made me feel worse with the constant backtalking people not talking two facedness and so on and dont want the same experience for you
having family that only cares about my grades,dude delt with the same shit just find balance in life school is your future your parents want you to be successful weather or not you see that now no offence man but maybe don go straight to sub with community of people diagnosed with depression to talk about school issues don mean to come off rude or anything but just try and talk to your parents about this or solve it domestically don classify it as depression tho please hope you figure it out tho man keep on the grind and it will pay off
thanksgiving alone,maybe they assumed you would show up without invitation your family after all it might just be they feel like you neglected them my advice go to the family event uninvited and try to find out why they never invited you if all goes well and it was miss understanding better if not let them go go make family to be honest even my family is toxic that why left still call and visit but not as often until they treat eachother including me better we all go through problems sometimes it makes us bitter to our loved ones goodluck sincerely
why do people avoid me when am sad,cant speak for you but ll speak for me maybe youre similar someone else crying being sad is just straight up uncomfortable for some people sometimes depression is contagious not just depressed depressing if get too symptomatic my friends dont want to try to help me not only because they dont think they can but because it makes them depressed ve actually stopped reaching out for help because of this being so depressed that so depressing it wears down other people until give them depression is well depressing ve even lost therapist to it before
my therapist dropped me as client,this sucks so bad know it hard to make light of situation like this but there lot of gratitude to be felt in finding at least one good therapist during your darkest time ve learned that good therapy will eventually act as your inner voice and those challenging situations and thoughts will be more tolerable if you tap into those conversations you had sorry this happened though is it possible to see if she has any colleagues she could recommend
thinking of deleting this account,it doesnt matter if people think its not big deal or its petty if it means something to you then its serious

at the end of the day the only one who could better myself,think youve very well and wisely encapsulated the depression dilemma in that it robs person of motivation but motivation is required to fix depression experienced the same for years if youre looking to drive wedge into this cycle think its possible to work on either end of it to hit the depression identify the root and undergo therapy medication to even out the source directly did this with cbt because had mental root though it was very slow going in the beginning to hit the motivation babystepping helped me lot when you want to have minute convos with random girls like did not saying this is your prob just my example its way easier to start at seconds you know

havent felt content with life since like,same thing happened to me you did good job describing it around for me life really stopped resembling anything like what it used to be its like being in an alternate dimension where things are slightly off ve joked with myself that maybe the end of the world stuff was actually true because this just doesnt feel real anymore or maybe died never see anyone anymore even if try super hard to make plans with someone or reach out to people almost like theres some rule in place that cant see anyone
just so tired,hear that and hear your feelings you are strong after what you have been through and handling the finances know some take it for granted but it really is an accomplishment to handle it continuously know it may be out of place but do you enjoy cooking know for me love some good homemade food and making meals at home is cheaper and satisfying to eat it after working for it play some holiday tunes and cook that helps me to lighten the mood love that you have such connection with the kids the love is so pure life tends to test us in many ways and really admire you for keeping your favorite holiday would say make the most of it yourself and if your girlfriend would like to join in on the festive mood then ayy and if not then who said one cannot enjoy their own company the time are chaotic now but we can do our little celebrations these are usually the thoughts tell myself here for the vents to let it out we all need it every so often from one reddit user to another happy thanksgiving

if ever get better how do forget,so wish knew feel exactly the same honestly wish could erase my memory and start afresh
can depression make it hard to feel anything even love,ve been struggling with this too the one thing thats helped me is thinking about this love isnt determined by what you feel in any one moment its determined by the life you build together and still choosing to continue to love her each day even when things are tough the fact that you feel like this about friends too definitely points to it being related to depression moreso than your relationship ve seen some threads that meds can help on meds while this is happening but looking at adjusting them as an option how long have you been feeling this way
nothing but burden,hey you re not alone get how you feel really do also wish was dead but honestly care for anyone dealing with this so gonna say do care about you idc if you say don know you because do we together suffer but that doesn mean give up bud so please try and keep that head up because one day sure if we keep going we will find happiness no guarantee though won lie but that doesn mean give up
what hate most about people who dont have depression but still try to help,you re right most people will judge you and think less of you because they don understand the way you feel it hard to want to open up to people sometimes because of that fear but sincerely hope that if you re ever given the opportunity to talk to someone who really just wants to listen that you ll take advantage of it because they re hard to find and you might find yourself screaming with no one to listen some day
please help me,not sure how to help but literally in the exact same situation as you right now
want to end it all,well if it helps eventually you ll reach the point where you want to cry but you cant
want to be someone else,dude feel for you know that feeling all too well one of the hardest things you can go through is comparing yourself to others especially if you do have depression but remember everyone has battle theyre fighting that you cant see these people youre comparing yourself to just keep in mind that theyre not in your shoes and as mentioned above youre not in theirs know its so much easier said than done but the only person you should ever compare yourself to is you who you are now vs who you used to be or even who you are now vs who you want to be in the future

lost heart palpitations thanksgiving with family,think that its important especially this time of year that we dont need to sacrifice our mental health and wellbeing to make family members happy understand that you care about your family but its not worth it if being home does bad things to you dont know how good of relationship you have with them but have you tried to tell them how being home makes you feel if they care theyll at least attempt to understand hope you get to feeling little better though and that things go well please take care of yourself

is weighted blanket worth its money,love my weighted blanket it was gift but personally it hasnt helped me feel any less shitty however google says the blankets show positive results in helping people with autism adhd and anxiety so think if they can say it has positive effect that means some people do find it helpful you will be different from everyone else just because it does work for others doesnt mean it will work for you and vice versa really if you are intent on feeling better find blanket that offers amount of days return policy that way if you dont like it you can return it
ll never be happy because perfectionist,same here the only reason feel theres is to live is making art but then get too self conscious and feel like everything do sucks and isnt good enough and pointless was taking lot of kratom but it dulls me out and makes me unproductive but sober is unbearable
is the only way to stay on top with pills,pills as its been explained to me have two purposes bump you up if youre in dangerous low keep you steadily on baseline or raise your baseline if its naturally low personally went to therapy for years before started taking pills and honestly they make world of difference for me they do things therapy never could still go to therapy but now have some extra help on daily basis
is it possible to seek medical help treat yourself without anyone knowing,if you are on your parents insurance you cant hide it if you have your own you can but really dont recommend it understand you dont think your parents will understand our be helpful but think about what happens if they find out you have been doing it behind there back if you really want to though all you have to do is make up an excuse of why you are going out to therapy and hide the medication depending on the side effects it might be tough depending on the effect some make you gain weight some make you irritable and some make you physically sick
new user looking for new perspectives in my year long battle,well think what youll find is that this board is most helpful when people share their stories and empathize with each other more common is combination of well wishes and advice which is nice but never really enough as for new perspectives um well my personal go to philosophy is that depression is often something like form of psychological starvation and the best way to treat it is to figure out what nutrients youre not getting rather than finding ways to block out the hunger for lot of people here that means that they need more meaningful social connections like friends who actually understand them and community that supports them which can be really difficult to come by depending on the circumstances of course thats more true of situational than idiopathic depression although the two arent entirely unrelated
should get professional help,yes you don even have to have serious issues to get professional help it always good to have therapist and it sounds like you would benefit from one
being ignored by someone that really care about sends me into tailspin every time,so sorry youre going through this most of us know this feeling some people find it easier to let go than others believe its personality trait that said heres what helps lots of self care you decide what that means to you wear rubberband when you think about that person snap it and say verbally or in your mind release you with love thanks for the good times and the valuable lesson learned avoid caffeine and alcohol get adequate sleep drink water and take more showers or baths than you normally do the water helps with grounding trust me they work
just want my brain to shut up for second,sometimes the forced thoughts hurt my eyes and make me feel anger cant control
five months of crippling depression and self hatred feel like can go on,you are your thoughts eventually no matter what dont feed negatives in brain

by calling depression an illness we ignore caring about the things that lead to depression,yes ve found it actually gives people opportunity to put the blame on the depressed person and to admonish themselves of any guilt around their own behaviour ie its your problem you should see therapist or take medication dont bother me about it
perfectionism is ruining my life feel like going backwards,get ocd but think my advice would be try to find the perfect in the imperfect
how much longer will this go on,it sounds to me that you have had genuine reasons to be upset and can understand how it led to depression the standard advice of healthy diet exercise meditation etc are always worth trying even as little or as much you can do whilst feeling like shit definitely worth speaking with therapist if you haven before as well but it sounds like to me you need tell your mum your feelings towards her actions and clear your chest if you haven already
my jokes about depression are cry for help and no one is listening,the last linkin park album was one big cry for help and everybody was like wow these lyrics are so deep he must ve matured so much and then my point being people that don suffer from mental issues will never understand how it is or catch the hints
like looking at my cuts especially the fresh ones,kinda do the same also do it when cut not perfectionist but if the cut isn straight or even line cut more until satisfied with how it looks
absolutely nothing brings me joy,you could always talk to people at school or work
trying my best just isnt enough,hey op hope my thoughts will find you well understand where you are coming from as it has happened to me before spent so much money on my friends in hope that they will accept me in their circle was there for my friends even if they dont treat me well it was waste and got nothing out of it remember all my friends birthday but they forgot mine after going through all that realise that got stronger as person because honestly its devastating to go through this for years realise that should only spend time with friends whom matters to me not or people maybe just or at most and if they dont accept you back or treat you well you should move on from them because trying more does not mean it will work but at least you can learn something which is that its good to know that they are not going to be your true friends as can you imagine doing the same thing for the next years applied the same to friend who asked me for dollars if they dont return it or they act non challant about it will just be glad because know wont have to invest on that friendship anymore hope that helps
not sure whats wrong exactly but need help,hey think your thoughts on social life is completely fine as going out to drinks when you dont like it will just shows on your emotion so you should stay being yourself whats the point of doing something you dont like take it easy in regards to talking to woman though perhaps you are overthinking about the interaction for me what do when talk to women is expect nothing from the interaction and that makes it so much easier give it try think of them just like as any other people hope that helps
my life is falling apart and dont know what to do,am waiting to hear from you again pal life has been hard on you but hang in there

honestly dont know what am doing anymore,get this so much always in that place and trying to avoid it from getting me still trying to figure it all out too so definitely don feel pressured to have it all figured out it hard get it currently trying to find job after leaving my last one bc it was horrible and made me extremely depressed now stuck trying to find something to make me feel important or useful again like you said for awhile was using anything could do try and stay happy months of doing what really love to do outside and now it finally to the point where can even use those things to escape my thoughts think it will get better for us though try to stay hopeful anyway btw you re very good at writing
you guys made me feel little less alone today,in world where people like us are looked down upon the best companionship well have is ourselves we all know how it feels to be depressed otherwise we wouldnt be here maybe we cant be happy together but we can certainly be sad together and remind ourselves that no matter what happens we arent alone in our experiences
im not happy,can relate but instead of drinking spend hours playing online games to forget how miserable my life is its also annoying seeing how most my friends have it easy in life maybe its jealousy or maybe tired of doing my best and not being rewarded for it either way try to see it like this yeah life is hard and mostly shit but imagine living the rest of your life tacking the challenges you face every day and grow to be an old person thats alot of perseverance grit tenacity and experience youve just gained that you can use to help others someday and you badass for making it so far

ve recently switched doctors after seeing the same one for years and my new one immediately referred me to behavioral health professional,if you are correct and they have broken hippa laws you should choose different therapist and relay those concerns to them do not share that concern with the two involved individuals because they could be bias and they would have reason to lie you need neutral person who can help you dissect those concerns and explore if they are valid and if so what you should do about them if you need the referral to get psych help because of insurance issues you can make gp appointment explain that your doc referred you to psych that they know personally and you suspect they discuss your personal medical details with and say youd like referral to someone neutral and trustworthy if youre in small town you can use telehealth options to find gp and also telepsych options

should mental health professionals advice client to lose weight get fit,psychologist and advising exercise and good nutrition is something that we do as far as specifically concentrating on weight would be hesitant unless client brought it up even then have focused more on intuitive eating in the past eating more nutritious foods exercising etc as opposed to using any kind of numerical measure for weight for one thing we know that bmi isn always an accurate indicator and two focusing on number can sometimes induce disordered eating don think there anything wrong with encouraging healthy habits but wouldn tell client to lose weight
need someone to help me out with this,dont know what could be causing it but recommend music quiet so it needs to be focused on or focusing really hard on writing story in your head those both give me distractions from my head
self care is not participating when you don want to,but also sometimes it about participating when you don want to sometimes our irrational and dysfunctional thinking can lead us to become socially withdrawn or inhibited and that can worsen our emotional state sometimes it also about pushing yourself to be with people you get along with and who care about you

update terrified of politically motivated violence,so sorry that people dont believe you that has to be all the more awful think the best thing to do is as suggested stay inside avoid people you dont trust when you can which is good advice during pandemic anyway by doing things like ordering your groceries by delivery and socializing digitally and if someone starts to get aggressive with you dont think there is any shame in letting them know that you are autistic and telling them that you cant process their questions properly because of it regardless of whether or not its true telling lie to keep yourself safe is perfectly acceptable also if you are able to move to an area where you feel safer that is reasonable option if you have to shelter in place try to add things to your entryway that would make you seem like an unassuming or unideal political target like sign that asks people not to smoke because oxygen is in use on the property which can suggest you are ill or living with someone elderly mind you these can also make you robbery target so youll have to balance the risks on both ends youre allowed to trust your instincts and youre allowed to use your best judgement to better your life there are people who dont want your experience to exist publicly because it does not suit their narrative but they need to deal with the fact that not everyone lives an experience that reflects the average experience think its good that you are not dissociating from yourself from your own life to appease strangers

postpartum tw suicidal thoughts self harm,hey at weeks the medicine may just about be starting to settle but not all the way there its good idea to see your doctor again and see if they want to change anything and tell them all the issues you have described in this post and remember no matter what you leave them they would both be such happier if you told your partner your struggling like you are and got help know some friends who lost people to suicide and it broke them theyd much rather of had chance to help the person they love and make sure they are okay also maybe seek counceling therapy psychiatrist help it will help and if you think youve decided to do it you may aswell try these first what harms it going to do to try fix things first its worth giving it all good go first am here if you want to dm havent been in your situation but ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm and here for you if you need

dont know what is happening to me,suggest you talk to therapist rather than asking strangers on reddit the sooner professional looks at you the easier it will be to recover theres no shame in seeking professional help there doesnt have to be something wrong with you to do it people seek therapy even for the smallest things like work related stress or having trouble getting up in the morning trust me you dont want to neglect any mental issues you suspect you might have the longer an unresolved problem exists in your head the worse it gets over time and it might take over your personality completely if this has started happening fairly recently it will be very easy for psychiatrist to help you the longer you postpone check up the worse it might get dont risk waiting for it to pass dont make the same mistake and many others did take care

enjoyment in being depressed and emotionally pained,no psychologist or psychiatrist but maybe you should talk to professional about it it sounds like self harming but emotional
dont really know how to title this so yeah,think that the best thing for you would be telling your friends that you can be their therapist because it makes you more anxious can understand that they trust you and want to talk to you about their problems but if your anxiety is that bad then your own mental health should be your priority it natural that you feel like this but it isn ok because it is overwhelming you your own mental health should be the most important thing to you no matter what learned this the hard way had mental breakdown because tried to support my husband during his mental breakdown and forgot about myself glad that you are getting help for your anxiety had bad anxiety still have anxiety but now feel like can control it learned how to not worry about others and how not to worry so much about things that are not important you ll get better

does anyone else feel like once they tell someone they have anxiety they aren taken seriously anymore,in my case feel people dont want to hear that they must feel somewhat out of place of violent about listening to mental health stuff so they make an effort to play down symptoms and claim every one struggles in some way as if they were forced to give you an answer they try to hard

was robbed at gunpoint tonight,perhaps this could be of help in the military we were taught how to use the assailant opponent as means of healing the idea is to take time to meditate on visualize the attacker as normal human being which he she obviously is regardless of circumstance who has succumbed to situation they never wanted to end up in imagine the harmless person and yourself where you are in something like priests role or similar competent listener motivated to provide solace the person then is the vulnerable one telling you about the difficulties that lead them up to creating the dramatic situation they share their fears regrets unmet needs diagnosis and the traumas they were exposed to by someone who had power over them when they were defenseless for example as innocent kids what happened in the situation in question is as absurd to them as it is to you hear the person out feel their shame and regret let them cry if they want to see yourself offering comfort and tell them you understand and forgive in the end you can both sit in silence just being there or separate as the two human beings you are if you find mental room don force anything feel how much energy you have available at the particular session and make sure it is sufficient to cover the main scenario you can also explain to the person in sober and non judgemental way how the situation made you feel doing this in particular in mental role play even without the other person in the picture helps your mind sort and categorize the experience in healing way as if you were talking to an actual listener the exercise is easy highly effective and flexible and should be done wholeheartedly every day for period what happens is that your memory starts adhering to and accepting this image of the person and overwrites the negative one with that the trauma is soon rendered powerless in the beginning you will need to watch your own thought tendencies closely they will try to impose the frightening situation on you from the get go want attention confirmation when that happens think of these insisting thoughts as confused child acting on auto just kindly but firmly tell it no not there this way take my hand the grown up here then you hold it there by your side while you build your setting create simple but credible mental image of the confession you can also add humorous elements to the scene if you want like silly background music placing yourself and the person in festive kinder garden locality etc don worry it will pass your mind is very capable of self healing little help like in this method helps speeding it up further

diagnosed with bpd yesterday has anyone got experience with quetiapine does it help,jen you likely will get more useful responses by referring to bd bipolar disorder instead of bpd borderline personality disorder whereas bpd is personality disorder that cannot be treated with medication bd is mood disorder that because it arises from chemical changes in the body often can be treated very effectively with medication quetiapine sold under the brand name seroquel among others is an atypical antipsychotic medication used for the treatment of bd incidentally having bd does not rule out also having bpd too about of bipolar sufferers also have bpd and about of people with bpd pwbpd have co occurring bipolar see table at study in clin psych further note that although bpd is the term used here in the united states nearly every other country calls it eupd emotionally unstable personality disorder as to your bd did your psychiatrist tell you it is bd or bd my foster son suffers from bd
why do feel like everyone hiding lots of things from me isolating me or avoiding me,not professional answer mental processes like these are often symptoms of very human and normal different anxieties or worries they can be abstract so the mind tries to make sense of the underlying feelings by building understandable models you can relate to they act like symbols serving the purpose of manifesting that which you have no words for worry about being alone without friends maybe because of some negative experience in the past becomes the imaginary existence of the secret group conspiring and having the time of their life but excludes you etc you have an abstract base feeling look around you in the world for something that can give that feeling frame you say you return to stable and lucid condition and recognize it as fantasies dramas that speaks against any delusional or outright paranoid states if you experience not being able to tell what really real and not like you become so convinced the evil scientists are spying on you that you can sleep because you think their car is parked in the street or you change the way you live your life travel in public go outside etc to avoid them you will have to seek professional advise with doctor

think have depression and honestly want to have it,what do you hope to achieve getting diagnosis cant go to proffesional right now and even if could it would be hard for me youve already ruled out seeing professionals but lets assume you get diagnosis from doctor at least they are going to probably recommend therapy or medication both of which is seeing professional not trying to discourage you from getting help but getting diagnosis really wouldnt change much for you everyone would recommend practicing mindfulness using meditation apps etc etc you can do all these things right now without diagnosis know everyone on here circle jerks to hating people who self diagnose do conceed that self diagnosing isnt all that helpful but not everyone can afford or has the means to see psychiatrist especially under year olds still on their parents health insurance fully think people who come up to you and say have bipolar depression add autism bpd and signs of mild schizophrenia but never went to doctor to confirm are definitely doing more harm then good but something like ya know really have self defeatist attitude and am never feel very happy maybe have depression is little more fine just by the way you say you think you might be broken and not able to ever be happy screams that you are struggling with depression so practice healthy mental habits and worry about getting super confirmed test later

hate how as guy automatically expected to suck it up and not show any emotion,hell yeah thank you for posting this and highlighting the mental health issues men face the research doesn lie men are at significantly higher risk of suicide as well as all sorts of externalizing behaviors excessive anger aggression substance use etc as man who works in the mental health field this issue resonates with my own experiences growing up with unrealistic expectations of manliness as you described we grow up with messaging all around us that we shouldn express sadness fear or anxiety because it betrays weakness that even to experience these emotions means we are somehow weak the only acceptable forms of public expression are happiness or anger and anything else either shouldn be there or should be suppressed this is exemplified in language like man up and suck it up and it teaches our boys to emotionally isolate society boxed men expression into happiness anger or keep it to yourself we were told that there are jobs men can have that are manly fire fighter logger and there are jobs men shouldn have that are for women secretary nurse when in reality it bullshit and you can work whatever job makes you happy but society has framed things such that we re mocked for choosing hobbies or jobs that are girly it fundamentally oppresses male expression and identity formation god forbid any of us inherently enjoy something framed as being for women and our friends and family will constantly deride us for being less than what weird is that society has been run primarily by men men have traditionally held positions of power in western society and have made laws and set cultural norms and yet our ancestors put these manly qualities on pedestal our society told us that those were the ideal manly qualities and anything else must be chastised this is how we ve collectively arrived in place that derides men as being gay for liking things that aren manly enough as if men are only allowed to like certain things and only allowed to love women and to be anything else is to be unmanly or worse womanly the whole frame is set up to shove us in box and then on top of it it teaches us that to be womanly is to be less than it not only constricts men freedom of expression but it also enshrines inequality between the sexes and this is where appreciate aspects of the feminist movement it the historic patriarchy that has put us in this box and told us what it must be to be manly also think that too many people view feminism as movement that means female empowerment at the expense of men which isn helpful approach toward social justice as you mentioned the reality is that the feminist movement is the first real movement to address the system that boxes in men expression and consequently forces women in nd rate positions as comparisons to ideal manliness feminists are not our enemy although it easy for us to get caught up in the dichotomous argument as if women empowerment means men must suffer what we need as men is our own movement led by men that carries the torch of feminism works hand in hand with the foundation they ve laid so far and then continues the work of deconstructing this box that society has forced men into and by doing so we indirectly empower men and women as equals so thank you for helping to carry the torch for men mental health hope you can see past the criticism you might get from people who frame feminism as anti male or at the very least more important than liberating the male identity really the two are inextricably linked we need feminism to help liberate men expression as much as feminism needs men to support their cause as allies two sides of the same coin in my view hope this helps one day at time my friend

dont want to do it but they force me,part of learning to be an adult is saying what you do and do not want to do if you dont want to play some sport which is supposed to be fun but its not then stop playing you can literally do whatever you want as hobby as long as its fun when was in school everyone wanted me to play football because am big guy however hate football culture hate sports fans and all the guy on the team were alcoholic date rape like children in high school am now much older man and look back on school like wtf were their parents thinking am glad wasnt involved in all the crap that was going on with my peers who were children if you are young reading this its crazy for an adult to think teenagers have beer parties and all of this weirdness anyway back to the sports bit did not want to be involved with any of that however have been involved in athletics since was teen and continue to be also used to work with pro football player from the broncos brought up to him how thought sports creates mental illness through black and white thinking meaning win or lose didnt know he was famous football play though some coworkers warned me that insulted him later he told me that was the most important thing he had ever heard in his life so being involved in sports is really only good for the exercise the culture can be gross and needing to win does not teach good mental health so if you want to quit quit and make sure you tell people why if someone tries to force you refuse to participate
my brother has bpd and has fear of being home alone because he said he loses his identity how can help him,natural yes people with full blown bpd borderline personality disorder usually hate being alone by themselves the reason is that in early childhood they never had an opportunity to build strong stable self identity or to learn the many emotional skills needed to regulate their own emotions this means that when your brother is home alone he doesnt have strong and stable sense of self to keep himself company to keep him grounded and to provide him with sense of direction and purpose this is one reason pwbpd seeks out partner having strong stable self identity as you likely know by now medication cannot make dent in bpd the only treatment proven to be effective in peer reviewed studies is professionally guided training program dbt tfp or cbt that teaches the pwbpd those missing emotional skills like learning to play piano it requires many years of continual practice to learn those skills so well that they become so natural and automatic that they are readily available when the person needs to use them

should take medication to help with depression and anxiety,for my experience talking to trained professional only did so much going to the gym only did so much taking healthy time for myself only did so much tried so hard to get out of my slump kept having panic attacks which are the worst so my therapist and decided to try medication was super scared never done anything like that before but for me it helped it wasn instant and had to understand the medication was tool to help me not life saver after about months slowly got off it this was only few months ago now feel good not my best self but nothing like did months ago before starting meds not professional but talk it over with professional it really might help and maybe it won but in my experience it what need last year it could help you note still have lot of anxiety probably always will to be honest but as long as not having panic attacks can deal good luck

thought about the phrase they were an adult so they should have known it was wrong,am and should have known better than to set fires little kids are taught that but also have mental illness that makes it almost impossible to stop myself when that urge to set fire hits yes know better but also stay as safe as possible when doing that make sure there are no animals people except for one incident for which was actually convicted of crime or vegetation nearby when burn something went to prison for year for burning small rag on the porch of an abandoned house no there was no damage anywhere had checked several times afterward and hadnt been caught until months later and there was no danger because had stayed there the whole time and had made sure it was out even though the asshole next door had still called the fd because it had been smoldering which is bs make sure my fires are out completely before leaving of the time it is just how work am not justifying what had done and had been punished rather over severely for it am getting minimal help now only because there isnt much psychologists and psychiatrists can do for me without drugging me up to the gills and locking me away from society forever am not that dangerous ffs stick to boxes and papers that is my thing so yeah know better just cant help what am do try my best to stay on the right side of the law now still set fires but small ones in controlled setting agree with you on this if you arent taught right from wrong then it will take young adult some time to actually learn those skills so we need to be more understanding of that

anybody else have secret rules they have to follow what are some of the ones youve noticed,have seen variety of secret rules in the slight odd set of people have met some good some bad these are not necessarily mental health based so this is bit off topic the greatest have ever seen was used by one of my closest friends in high school he would always say good things for each bad thing he said about person even if they where not in the rule only after we drifted did realise how strong that rule was another rule was by close family friend who would always to minutes more than his coworkers day this was the ultimate differed gratification as he didnt get paid but his hardworking nature was noticed so he was first in line for any training or promotions the most fucked up rule have seen was from an ex who was masterful at manipulate guys which unfortunately included me she would never form constant pattern of communication she admitted this in the times we have spoken since because it would keep you wanting more and allow her to control when and if you spoke this was obviously quite damaging finally my grandad has said always stood by his rule of say as much as you can in as little as you can this makes him amazing to talk to because he has learnt to say in three words what most cant in thre hundred have seen quite few more but dont want to write novella have you seen any that stand out

morning anxiety,had this when was teen my counselor said that good place to start to figure out what is causing the anxiety is to look at what you are doing and thinking about right before you go to sleep if you are staring at screen or gaming that might be part of it or for me at least it was that would be thinking about what needed to do the next day also go to doctor and maybe ask them about this they could probably ask better questions to help you figure out what is causing the anxiety oh and try to avoid eating right before bed it can cause you to not sleep as well good luck op

keep having intensely irrational thoughts,hey think some level of what if thinking throughout the day is normal but if your fixating on it or you genuinely fear that it will happen thats maybe little less common id try few techniques to try and relax and getting your racing mind under control maybe some deep breaths or even few minutes of meditation when you feel yourself going could help if nothing like that is working id suggest going to doctor its probably something as simple as little stress or just too much energy but id go to doctor if nothing else is working just to be on the safe side anyway hope everything works out and good luck

pressuring people to be happy all the time is one of the fastest ways to make people unhappy,absolutely agree back in middle school early high school was always known as the cheerful one in my friend group pretty much all of my friend group had major mental health issues which my friends talked about frequently on the other hand was always there to crack jokes and cheer them up they thought was some happy bubbly kid started to believe it myself and on days where felt down days where would complain and feel miserable they would complain about how down was they would tease me and mock me even though was doing exactly what they usually did just had to keep being the cheerful one and if wasnt they acted like it was my fault their day was now ruined one time even lashed out at one of them on day like this and shoved them against locker not violent person never have been but that day was very close to beating the shit out of my best friend after that learned my lesson sucked it up plastered on smile even when wasnt feeling it especially when wasnt feeling it comforted my friends when they felt upset making my jokes any care or acknowledgment of my mental health had taken up until that point vanished entirely it wasnt until years later in therapy when was did realize how much bottled shit up and that by the time went into therapy if hadnt gone when did it might have finally overflowed

when the depths of the truth are too terrible to possibly imagine,to be honest don know why we are here or why am trying and well the minute convinced myself that it was useless to find reason and would just make it tougher to try the problem slowly went away not saying in good mental state otherwise would be in another subreddit but my issues are now different which is nice change objectively if you are socially inept stupid and useless use it to your advantage say what you think make dodgy jokes but not hurtful to others insult yourself it makes people around more confident when you are able to joke about yourself and when you don care about your life that something you are able to do anyhow do not hesitate to write if your thoughts ever get more intense know the feeling and well would have appreciate anyone support so believe me if it happens get it and want to help even if am not qualified to good luck

convinced myself better than everyone else to deal with zero self esteem,hi am really sorry to hear your story but am not pitying you am not an expert but from what you wrote can understand that your early trauma has made you prone to conditioning behavioral trait regarding adverse situation let me explain bit your mind thinks if you dont give certain someone something they wont love or respect you it is distorted thinking process but with right therapy especially cognitive behavioral therapy cbt you can rewire your neural pathways and learn to think in new way because my friend there are bad people on earth but there are certainly some good people who will love you unconditionally my advice as psychology student would be you find good trauma therapist and work with him her dont know who you are or where you live but as person understand your pain and trust me there is remedy best of luck
the police were called to my address last night and can calm down or feel better,hi there just wanted to say that had similar thing happen was upset and crying and probably yelling and downstairs neighbors called the cops to do wellness check on me and when it happened thought it was the worst most embarrassing thing ever and even now six months later it not super great memory but it receded and things got better and what think about both of our situations is that if we are in so much distress that other people think the police should be involved although the police are imho definitely not the best people to help here but that different conversation then the most important thing is that we are in lot of distress and that is more immediately important than someone else quiet hours you got this time will pass and this will become easier to manage you will be ok in the meanwhile hope you have people who can help you manage your distress did not but got through mine anyway but it will definitely be easier if you have people to talk to
do dreams mean anything,dreams can have meaning in psychological sense and in spiritual sense sometimes both they are not prediction of the future but rather your subconscious trying to get message across if remember correctly recurring dreams about your girlfriend cheating on you is probably more about fear you have than the possibility of her actually cheating on you if you want my personal opinion and not doctor at all just have some experience with dream interpretation for myself it sounds like youre afraid of being betrayed you mentioned having been unfaithful in past relationships so maybe youre afraid youll be betrayed and feel you deserve it most of the time dreams like this are an expression of insecurity your mind is probably telling you something along the lines of hey this is problem you need to work on look fix
how do know if depressed,sadness isnt always symptome but when it clings for few weeks in row thats probably depression my school has few papers about depresion so allow me to ask few questions so can help you have you lost interest in hobbies and pleasures do you tend to feel pain in stomach or muscles hows your sleep do you have problems going asleep weight and appetite changes do you have episodes of shouldnt be alive suicidal thoughts are one thing but asking if you ever feel disgusted with yourself is it true that you cant feel genuine joy no matter what how short is your temper do you ever feel that you cant change your situation have you lately become impulsive and unwilling to plan sorry if sound rude and overwhelming but just need this information

need help not sure if this is good place to post this but need help understanding something bc its affecting me emotionally and affecting my relationship with my gf,something people often overlook or misunderstand about mental health is that emotional boundaries are essential right now yours are very permeable people think they should care all the time about everything empathy like anything is healthy in appropriate doses but youre overdosing yourself now youre feeling the consequence of that emotional over investment its fatiguing and its ruining your own stability the best way to aid one another is to first help ourselves its not selfish its self preservation we cannot be there for others nor can we help them until we ourselves put in the work to get right you need separation to get right not saying break up create some physical distance practice some self care where you focus more on your own needs when you have intrusive thoughts that involve the gf take note and then refocus your thoughts onto something else it takes training and practice to build and maintain emotional boundaries they are vital for positive mental health until youve established stronger boundaries for yourself you must limit the amount of influence gf has over you otherwise you will go through life bearing this double burden and thats recipe for disaster tell the gf that you need to become stronger person for her and mainly yourself which means you need some alone time to work on yourself
keep wanting to go back to self sabotaging habits,feel you hard there find that it comes and goes in waves whenever you acknowledge that you are engaging in or considering self sabotatging habit you gain little power over it when youre in that emotion you know you are vunerable to making bad decision so distract yourself with comedy take nap listen to book most times for me when get like that not in space where feel like can do something about it that is to say after taking space from it you can brainstorm from there but few things that have done is talk to my friends if you dont have any join discord or start conversation on casualconversation even if it doesnt work thats okay youre not the same from when you first started doing these self sabotaging habits and when youve stopped and started again you have power and experience over this emotion state you can do this
my job is driving me insane am going crazy,you re not going mad but it sounds like you re really tired and could do with little break there nothing wrong with doing job just for the money that what most people do only few are lucky to do job they love however burnout is also real personally never make decisions when tired or upset as know can think straight and end up regretting it if you can take few days off maybe consider that if not on good day maybe on the weekend write down list of pros cons of quitting your job also think carefully how you ll feel if you ll temporarily lose your income will you be ok will you worry etc then based on that list it may be easier to make decision maybe you ll decide to quit only when you have an other job lined up or maybe you ll decide to quit straight away because you can handle an other day but have enough saved up to afford it only you know that it took me many years to find job didn hate my advice is to try and not focus on how much you hate the job as it ll make it worse and will use up lot of energy but on the fact that it just means to an end and it temporary you work to live you don live to work if the job is making you enough money to live it serving its purpose then use your energy to plan your next move and keep working towards that hope it ll get better for you soon you re clearly very smart strong individual you ve come so far so don feel disheartened and if you don see any upsides in staying even after you ve rested then don feel bad about leaving you come first

whats considered the best physical exercise for mental health,good for you for taking initiative and looking for steps to help with your mental health have always found that running has helped me to better manage my mental health supposedly cardiovascular exercise produces endorphins which help you to feel good and stay positive the other great thing about running is that you don need gym you can do it anywhere admittedly it can be hard thing to start especially if your base fitness level is low and the weather sucks but equally it is super rewarding if you stick with it and start to see progress would recommend one of the many free running apps available they will allow you to monitor your progress and set goals for things like times and distances give it go try to go out for mins every other day for two weeks accompany this with some veg with your food and lots of water am willing to bet that if you keep to it for weeks you will feel somewhat better edit grammar

health on top of mental health,sorry to hear that ve just checked how white tongue looks like would probably try to continue testing different meds for that and maybe something will change if it comes to the depressive episode its quite difficult in bipolar do you take meds think you should contact your psychiatrist bipolar is bit deeper problem related to chemical imbalance in the brain so things like positive thinking are not so easy if you already take meds you can also try to change them and it should be discussed with your psychiatrist hope you will be okay

girl interested in needs week of mental preparation time to leave the house is there name for this,social anxiety isn always obvious isn for me at least apart from my talking and it can be just in certain situations scenarios eg fine with calling but talking in person is anxiety inducing my social anxiety acts up in pretty much most social situations with my biggest issue being crowded places places with lots of people like the shops busy restaurants or festival event fair etc however from the way you describe her personality it sounds like she may just be true introvert lol nothing wrong with that might just be that she finds she needs to work up the energy needed to be around others outside of her home whereas with talking on the phone to you she more comfortable and still somewhat has her own space the definition of an introvert is feeling recharged by being alone lol so yeah say she probably either introverted or if that one week of mental preparation is filled with her worrying overthinking it then it social anxiety

girlfriend victim of sexual abuse emotional detachment,this happens for sure survivors and people with ptsd often have severe trust issues and responses of flight and avoidance the best thing you can do is give her space and time if you want to remain open to her you should but also make sure you maintain boundaries for yourself and don be punching bag or doormat for her went through something similar with my last ex she deals with major childhood trauma and trust issues as well we were together for five years and had even talked about wanting to get married then one day she was acting different and told me she needed space and the next day she was gone it took long time but we started talking again and she told me she had manic break wasn the perfect partner but what we had was really good but when it came down to really trusting and committing to each other she couldn do it and had to run this is what she told me it been years and we still love each other and talk pretty regularly but we re different people now and it just doesn feel the same anymore so yeah it just sucks and there not much you can do except support her in her journey of healing and let her be whatever she needs to be right now without giving so much of yourself that it becomes harmful to you that is which can be tough to discern sometimes sorry it such terrible feeling to be left hanging and not understanding what exactly went wrong hope things get better

brother been severely depressed and suicidal my entire life refuses therapy or any kind of help my parents still take care of him what do do when they re gone,this is tough situation and so sorry that you re dealing with this unfortunately if he is refusing to go to therapy and refuses to get help then there really not much you can do person has to be willing to get help in order for them to start feeling better when it comes to this stuff if you re worried about him taking his own life then most states have options for people to get involuntarily committed if they are danger to themselves the only thing you can do is reach out to them and let them know that you love them and want them to be happy and that they are not alone also it may seem harsh but you have to remind yourself that you are not responsible for other people happiness if he refusing help that is on him not you if you ve tried and tried but he refusing you ve done as much as you can again so sorry about this situation

is it normal to not really feel empathy towards people who are showing an overt display of emotion,if this is really bothering you you can discuss this with therapist who would be better educated on how to answer your question as disclaimer have no doubt that you are good person who cares about people so no worries empathy and sympathy are kind of sliding scales theres folks with low empathy who can sympathize well and they function fine theyre good people on the other end theres empaths that feel everything in room and can get sick by the emotions of others if they dont manage themselves well if this turns out to be your norm then thats okay nothing wrong with it you can be perfectly good person with lower empathy levels you could also be shutting down to dampen the stress of situation without realizing ve definitely been exactly how you described when was doing horrible mentally and consider myself on the empath side of the scale are you depressed by chance that could explain this if it isnt your normal
should seek therapist or dietician,hi not professional but as fifth year medical student who is really passionate about healthy eating and supports mental health would suggest both if you already think you might have an eating disorder or if you had one in the past you should definetly see therapist he she can help you understand your emotions and the reason you might seek comfort in food is really important to understand the kind of relationship you have with food in order to make it non toxic one understanding your emotions and why they lead you to act the way you do will help you confront and accept them after that if you give yourself the time you need you will be able to handle your emotions and your relationship with food much much better and it will also help with the relationship you have with yourself the dietician will help you understand why you should avoid certain foods and how to replace them with better healthier alternatives the point of dietician is not to make you loose weight but help you eat according to your bodys needs and if you have any extra weight that might be considered unhealthy it will come of naturally also suggest you exercise start with something simple experiment find what makes you happy with yourself afterwards and keep doing it would be very happy to answer more questions and give you more advice from my own experience shall you need some more so feel free to pm me anytime

what do do at this point,you have family right when ever feel like its better if killed myself think of my little sis never being able to see her big brother and my big brother hes the nicest man know and is always pushing me to do the right thing how is he going to feel
feeling ignored,that could be sign that you are possibly talking too much most people have such short attention spans it could be that it also could be sign that some people are annoyed with you maybe confront your family about it depending on if their honest that might help you
any suggestions therapist wont tell me this,ruminating is hard to beat the only thing that seems to calm those thoughts are meditation or confrontation can help you with meditation because it is super difficult for me but can help you with confrontation first you need to acknowledge that people hurt you and you have every right to want revenge then you have to confront your thoughts with statement every time bad though comes up make sure you have reply ready you want to practice this reply so much that it becomes an instant response for example yes he hurt me but thinking about him now is taking time away from my life and happiness and deserve to be happy yes she did that but she not here anymore she can hurt me yes that happened but different now am living different life and will not let it stand in my way yes this happened but am going to bed now and will see you tomorrow at am literally think of yourself as call service agent getting unnecessary calls around the clock and just tell them off tell all these thoughts off like you wouldn be able to do at an actual job be sassy and strong and righteous every time you tell these thoughts off you get stronger hope this helps
what do do feel like complete failure,tell tour parents straight up do you think whats worse them finding out by them self or you telling them and remember that those fails make you better person your smart and know you can see your fails and thats why you can improve
dont know what to do anymore and need guidance,go back to when it started what was happening in life how old were you were you going through major life changes or personal ones try to find the root and work your way out highly recommend therapist from the sound of it but if thats not possible find somebody anybody that you can comfortably talk to and try to work it out piece by piece its hard now but with work it can and will get better
in need of advice,stay strong your loved stop thinking about the next minutes and think about what you could make of ur self in the next years every human being has purpose so go out explore be happy fine the love of ur life and be happy
is being open and unapologetic about your mental health issues to your friends acquaintances worth it,so ve just started recently and also so my friends are probably bit different but if someone asks me how doing always ask them if they really would like to know or if just asking out of kindness in which case tell them how doing and if they choose to follow up or ignore it thats on them but am not going to hide thing anymore if ask them also would love to hear their deepest darkest struggles but if they arent about that then thats cool too

how to best support someone who has borderline personality disorder,how to best support someone who has bpd portland my experience with bpd exw is that you cannot support or help her unless she is already strongly self motivated to help herself until your pwbpd has had many years of intensive therapy in program such as cbt or dbt whatever you do likely will be wrong much of the time she will perceive you as being hurtful when you do something and hurtful when you dont do it this conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears abandonment and engulfment at opposite ends of the very same spectrum this means you often find yourself in lose lose situation because as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear drawing close and being intimate is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear likewise the solution to calming her engulfment fear moving back away to give her breathing space is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear hence as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear making her feel like shes being suffocated and controlled by you yet as you back away to give her breathing space you will find that youve started triggering her abandonment fear in my years of experience with my bpd exw found that there is no midpoints solution between too close and too far away where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears until pwbpd learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears that goldilocks position will not exist this is why relationship with an untreated pwbpd typically is characterized by repeating cycle of push you away and pull you back indeed even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying word pwbpd who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality and to externalize the pain getting it outside her body because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you hence as long as you remain in relationship with an untreated pwbpd you will often find yourself hurting her triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still in room saying absolutely nothing

where to go for bpd diagnosis uk,who do go to spring gp is not qualified to diagnose you for bpd you need to go to therapist ideally psychologist or psychiatrist if the therapist only has masters degree in psychology however he she may still be very good at diagnosing personality disorders if he she has many years of experience in doing it suggest starting with psychologist because they typically charge half what psychiatrist charges and are at least as good when diagnosing personality disorders yet because am in the states am unfamiliar with the uk health system your comment indicates that the only way you can be seen by psychologist in the uk is to be referred to one by gp given your situation it sounds like that wont happen for at least more years after you move am sorry to hear that pretty sure have bpd it developed over the past years now currently as noted above if you have full blown bpd it was developed by the time your were years old the strong bpd behaviors however typically do not start showing until the early to mid teens as you likely know bpd is spectrum disorder that we all have to some degree it is pattern of primitive ego defenses we all use they become problem only when our bpd symptoms become so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close ltrs with other adults the human condition is that whenever we experience very intense feelings our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples intentions and motivations significantly this is true for all adults this is why whenever we are very angry we all try hard to keep our mouths shut and our fingers off the keys until we have chance to cool down we know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings well pwbpd is like this too only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions this means that pwbpd experiences very intense feelings and hence the distorted perceptions far more frequently than other people sure that have bpd if you do suffer from full blown bpd you likely experienced trauma in early childhood from inherited genes and or your environment that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills most major cities offer excellent treatment programs dbt tfp and cbt that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions they can teach you how to do self soothing how to regulate your own emotions how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as facts and how to trust others they also can teach you how to be mindful to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future how to perceive object constancy to see that your partners personality is essentially unchanged day to day and how to avoid black white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings uncertainties ambiguities and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships absent those skills you must continue to rely heavily on the primitive ego defenses used by young children projection denial temper tantrums dissociation magical thinking and black white thinking my gp said it sounds like have mild case of bpd perhaps he is correct spring bpd is not something like chickenpox that person either has or doesnt have instead it is spectrum disorder which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all bpd traits to some degree usually at low level if the person is healthy at issue then is not whether you exhibit bpd traits of course you do we all do rather at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at strong level are on the upper end of the bpd spectrum how serious the problem is depends not only on how strong our bpd traits are but also on whether they are persistent constitute full lifetime problem temporary bpd flareups most occurrences of strong bpd traits you see in other people are not caused by lifetime bpd instead they are only temporary flareups of the normal bpd traits we all have these flareups usually are caused by drug abuse or even more often by hormone change puberty pregnancy postpartum severe pms or perimenopause or any other life event starting with the letter lol pms can cause strong bpd behavior to occur for several days each month with perimenopause or postpartum the temporary bpd flareup may last several years persistent bpd traits if serious hormone and drug problems can be ruled out the remaining common cause of strong bpd traits is stunted emotional development something occurring before age five that caused emotional development to freeze at the level of young child this is lifetime bpd unless the person undergoes years of training to learn the missing skills spring the vast majority of these full blown pwbpd statistics suggest to of them are high functioning this means that they typically hold jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers clients casual friends and total strangers none of those people is able to trigger the pwbpds fears of abandonment and engulfment there is no close relationship that can be abandoned and no intimacy to trigger the suffocating feeling of engulfment hence with most pwbpd the strong bpd symptoms usually appear only when someone casual friend makes the mistake of drawing very close to the pwbpd this is why it is common for high functioning pwbpd to excel in very difficult jobs such as being social worker teacher surgeon attorney or salesman and this is why most pwbpd can be considerate and friendly all day long to complete strangers but will go home at night to express anger against the very people who love them
my sister just told me that she is feeling and hearing some being once week what should do please help me out,oh picked up few of these over the years understand your conscious mind is you as person and is what keeps you and your body up and about you have no control over you unconscious mind however and this is what connects us all together heaven is in fact our collective unconscious minds and ghost is just one of these tagging along with you here when it should be over there if you do not know what you are doing they can hurt you take over your body and do bunch of other bad stuff unless they are friendly and then they just sorta hang out and dont cause issues and can even let you know something is up tell her to close her eyes and envision opening ring or portal of light over her head expand it out to cover the whole room and guide the spirit into the light so it can go back where it belongs usually they want to go anyways but they will let go of you fuck off if they dont want to go back for what ever reason as they will get pulled through by force if they stay to close to it for too long its one way path from here to there if she cant manage that she may need to get someone who knows that sort of stuff hands down to do it for her and guide that soul back to the whole where it belongs all said and done it is sad and in pain as down here it is only fragment of what it was and well how would you like to be missing arms and legs granted for them its more like missing pieces of once mind and memory which is what can make them unstable and dangerous

what is wrong with me,honestly this could be many things but wont list them cos its not helpful dont know what the mental health services are like where you live but pls reach out to them outside that pls talk to your fam if feel its safe to do this isnt good for especially at such crucial point in your life you dont need diagnosis not from me nor from your fam or yoursslf you need support get nightlight talk to your fam about your anxiety and also ur school of there avenues for that not all schools are helpful so if you think it will do more harm than good leave it main point you need support at home professional help takes time depending on where you live were taking years so make sure the people around you know how to help would suggest checking out mind org and the hearing voices network which sure have local sites worldwide theyre mainly for auditory hallucinations but they can help with visual anomaly as well suffer auditory hallucinations and severe anxiety etc as well so if you want to ask anything in depth pm me
has anyone ever gone through something like this feeling weird,maybe this story will help clarify what talking about so when first started meditating started because wanted to get rich yes no joke my motivation for meditating was because thought it would give me an edge when it came to being entrepreneurial doing well in school increasing focus ect so could make more money basically the weird part is when started when was convincing my self to keep meditating when it was giving me no results would tell myself that it was working that was elevating my consciousness that was becoming enlightened and it now feels like it actually is happening thats the part that makes me so uneasy its bittersweet literally feel like in the matrix simulation or like how jim carrey mustve felt in the truman show when he realized what was really going on
feeling overwhelmed,take this from someone whos currently going through the toughest time of his life gf of years is ending things you are good enough fuck those feelings that you arent you were good enough to land this hottie in the first place shes stayed with you long enough for this not to be quick fling its not going to be easy but youre going to have to retrain your brain to think differently dont be so harsh on yourself everyone makes mistakes but choose to learn and grow from them cant pretend to understand whats going on with you or how serious it is but seek help be open with your gf or friends or whoever bottling up your feelings gets you nowhere but where am now and wouldnt wish this on single person be the better person wish had of been the person trying to be even though its too late for me its not too late for you you have to believe in yourself and trust me if its meant to be those arguments will fade believe in you believe in yourself

how much does childhood trauma affect present me how do get better,once had therapist who just let me go to therapy and talk about my trauma for an hour but it didnt actually help make any improvement in my life find it is best to talk about trauma in context when it arises but to otherwise not go to therapy with the sole intent of talking about it for example if something happens in the present that reminds you of the trauma or if you are having flashbacks then it helps to talk about the trauma so as to process it however have found that excessive introspection and the constant inward looking to figure out why am the way am quickly got unhealthy and damaging eventually causing more distress than relief childhood trauma can feel really pervasive throughout your life everything can seem dysfunctional and linked to it but my advice is not to dwell on this but to focus on hobbies friendship your present life and address any issues as primarily current problem because even though you might know the issues stems from childhood the way to heal is to meet those needs in the present like to see it this way whats still causing the distress is that the present self currently has access to the past but your childhood self does not have access to the present this is whats keeping the both of you in traumatised state because its one way road that only goes backwards to the traumatic past replaying repeating and intruding on the present however its not continuously going back to the past and analysing it that will heal you but its you bringing your childhood self into the present by giving yourself what you needed back then in the here and now that will heal core aspect of childhood trauma is that the child feels like they cannot escape the traumatic environment and so in healing it is our job to let that traumatised child part of ourselves know that actually it was not an inescapable situation and we can escape it and we can also go on to find happiness and safety absolutely acknowledge the trauma and understand how it effects the present but with the intent of using it to meet unmet needs in the now

what was it like being arrested for calling the hotline,even as someone with largely negative emotions towards inpatient mental health care can safely say its not as bad as youre thinking imagine less insane asylum and more like hospital with less medical gear blue scratchy blankets inoffensive tv shows showers that never get hot enough the general purpose is to be as mediocre as possible so it gives people break from real world stress but also isnt too nice cause yknow budget cuts not the rest of your life probably less than week drug eh maybe some people dont like psychiatric meds and get that it also depends on what youre there for and what youve already tried beat no not much else to say but that once again not downplaying anyones negative experiences with inpatient care our system is in desperate need of reform but it can have its place and its benefits and its nowhere near how youre describing

what do the ambulance doctors do when they come to your house really scared and they are coming and idk what to do,the paramedics will look after you and treat any wounds so they dont get infected they may take you to hospital for further treatment and to make sure youre safe they wont hurt you or try to hurt you the only time they should use restraint is if youre either attempting to hurt yourself or someone else and then they should only use the least restrictive option available they will probably take you somewhere quiet so you arent overwhelmed youll be assessed by specialist childrens doctor itll make things much easier if you go with the paramedics voluntarily theyll look after you and help you get the care you need sweetie youre and very unwell it doesnt have to end like this

my doctor essentially told me to suck it up,have similar diagnosises and understand how it feels the problem with mental health help is that there are two types of patients that are treated very differently the mild average mental health sufferer are the ones that professionals and doctors like they are not disabled by their mental illness and are considered productive and useful to society people in this group can go to college get degrees and hold down jobs they are essentially rewarded for being functional and not disabled the second group of mental health sufferers on the other hand like myself are hated and looked down upon by health care professionals and society as whole we are disabled by our mental illnesses to the point where we can not go to school or hold down jobs we are seen as useless and unproductive members of society it people with more debilitating and severe mental illnesses that get all the hate and stigma where as more functional mentally ill people do not get the same level of hate and stigma people like to focus on milder cases of mental illness because it has happier ending the person struggles they get help they lead productive lives while getting their illness somewhat more under control for functionality there needs to be more support and understanding for mental illness as disability not all of us are going to be normal and that should be acknowledged and be ok and the professionals really shouldn demonize whole group of hurting people because by labeling people as productive or useless they are contributing to suicide in people with more serious illnesses if you feel like you are worthless or useless because everyone is alluding to that then it no wonder people feel like suicide is way out we all could use little compassion and support

think might be self sabotaging,hi am in cycle of this at the moment but just have to remind myself that am human and humans require suitable breaks and rest periods it sounds like you re not getting the rest you deserve which is why you feel like you re lacking energy in other places from the sounds of it you sound very stressed but too tired to do anything about it you chose to sleep instead of work which is good for you humans need sleep but in doing so your stress hormones produce even more stress and you feel guilty for doing what is actually human necessity how handle this is by giving myself small chunks of things to do and then allocating myself appropriate time to sleep and relax even add rest time to my to do list it is nice to tick things off and it is even more rewarding when you get to tick something off the list all nice and refreshed this way feel less stressed when do sleep and rest because know have achieved something that day and that my rest is part of the to do list too know it is not going to be easy but remember diamonds are made under pressure

how to help spouse without having recurrence myself am the problem want to hear the truth,it seems to me that you ve shown him an enormous amount of understanding and compassion this is supposed to be partnership but it sounds more like he your dependent if you re making all the money and taking care of the adult responsibilities so that he can be unemployed and get drunk that is not fair to you you need to firmly communicate to him that it not okay and you need more of partnership doesn he want to help he needs to fix his drinking yesterday drinks per day is absurd it going to kill him he needs to quit for his health physical and mental and so that he can get job and live more fulfilling life and you need to stop judging yourself and feeling ashamed for trying to communicate healthy boundaries talk to your shrink about this saying don want to be the sole breadwinner is not attacking him or demonstrating lack of empathy it communicating your needs clearly and that is absolutely what needed here it very obvious that you love him very much and want to see him improve his mental health he should realize this and be able to understand that you need some help supporting the life you two have built without having his ego bruised so bad he turns it into an argument or somehow makes it your fault if he thinks that simply your feeling better is going to fix his problems he delusional only he can fix his drinking problem only he can start pulling his weight and make the marriage feel like true partnership sure you often feel more like his parent than his partner my advice is to have frank conversation with him where you set some goals with times attached to them not saying like quit drinking in three weeks or leaving but goals need times and measurable outcomes or they aren any use sure you re well aware that this can just go on as it is things need to change and he needs to be willing to make those changes not just for you but also for him best of luck

my mum and had an argument,it might have been little unfair to say that if it came from place of frustration and anger towards the situation with tour sister think it would be best to calmly apologize to your mother for what you said and explain how you were just frustrated because of how she enables your sister and maybe she ll realize the severity of what she is actually doing
told my mother how feel,remember telling my mom that was having suicidal thoughts felt so ungrateful of course it scared her but was just telling her that had an illness years later now were both really glad we were able to talk about it and we both know lot more about depression than we used to including some family history of depression that wouldnt have learned about otherwise hope that todays conversation no matter how difficult will prove to be an important step toward your own recovery and perhaps toward an even more fulfilling and mutually supportive relationship with your mom best
can should get on disability if constantly feel like crying and suicidal,my sister has lupus and pots syndrome both of which are auto immune disorders it took us years to get her any sort of help from the government and we had the help of doctors who had diagnosed her so highly doubt they would allow you to go on disability especially since mental health is treated so differently and the government would argue since it isnt physical ailment you could be trying to defraud the government
just want to not suffer,hey mate sorry for your situation if your therapy and meds arent working wouldnt be better to change them is that possibility
am having symptoms am severely conflicted but fear getting diagnosed,this is definitely safe space to share your thoughts reading through what youve posted it certainly sounds like youre battling depression those sinking lows that youre describing that come over you even when youre amongst friends and doing things that should be fun sounds lot like typically depressive symptoms ve also found that my blood sugar levels are much harder to control when my mood is low or when my anxiety levels are high its particularly bad because ve noticed an almost cyclical pattern because as sure youre aware its hard to function properly when your blood sugar levels arent under control too low and youre feeling exhausted and dizzy understand the fear of speaking to doctor but there might be something to gain from speaking to mental health professionals do think if your country university has access to it that you should look to see psychologist therapy can be super useful everything is confidential and its safe space for you to try and unpack things that youre working through friends can be nice but they arent professionals and cant give clinical support for our mental health that said its super useful to be able to reach out to your friends having honest open conversations with friends is key to strong and healthy friendships one way to broach the subject is to ask them if they have the mental strength and capacity to handle some heavy subjects if they say no accept this even if its hard to do we each need to watch out for ourselves too boundaries are important in friendship too lastly if after seeing psychologist if you both feel that you might need medication then you can both look at making plans to see psychiatrist thank you for reaching out for help happy to chat with you if youd like

feel like burden on my friends,dont know your situation or the situation of your friends however also struggle with this what has been helping me is looking for the small things that friends do tagging me in something or sharing something they think would find interesting or funny this tells me that they think about me sometimes and they went out of their way to make sure see it my whole friend group knows to some degree that suffer from anxiety depression and ptsd sometimes they dont know what to say or react when at really low place but they still try thats what tells me they arent faking or pitying its hard to keep it in mind especially when my own brain is yelling at me and telling me all the opposite of what is true think if you talk to your friends or even just one and open up about these worries think you may be pleasantly surprised sorry if this is little disjointed woke up only short while ago hope this helps even little good luck

think completely done with this shit,hi there after come long way in my recovery with anxiety depression realized that my eating had become disordered which is what now focusing on lot of our ideas and feelings around food come from our families and eating around other people is high on the list of triggers for folks who struggle with disordered eating eating disorders if you have the resources to find therapist thatd be great but either way think you would benefit from virtual peer support group which you can find by location by searching the websites for nami national alliance on mental illness or the dbsa depression and bipolar support alliance hearing from and sharing with other people who at least kind of get it can be very powerful experience if you are feeling unsafe including not being able to eat enough to survive you can go to an emergency room or see if local hospitals have phps partial hospitalization programs or iops intensive outpatient programs know that some hospitals have programs specifically designed around disordered eating all the best
avoiding work due to depression due to avoiding work due to de ad infinitum,so made similar post recently about how hard its been too get anything done at work know the struggle still struggling were using annoyance to cope with the awful feelings the work brings up but then putting off the work creates more awful feelings and more avoidance sorry youre going through this youre not alone the number one thing that helped me was telling someone dont know if youre like me but kept my struggle secret because was so scared and anxious letting it out helped reduce the feelings little it doesnt have to be your family told my supervisor maybe there are advisors or friendly classmate you could tell in therapy and my therapist tried to help some things shes suggested that might help go to start your work when you feel like you want to avoid sit with those feelings let yourself feel whatever comes up cry punch pillow whatever just dont let yourself walk away and go to distraction the feelings are there for reason and facing them is important write down your feelings get them all out and be honest so you know truly whats holding you back for me one of my biggest issues was my fear of embarrassment or having others look down on me for my poor performance but had to face that cant change the past and cant change what others think the work will be there either way and avoiding it just makes my fear more likely set minutes timer where you work even if you end up staring at your work the whole time you commit to not doing anything else for that minutes then try another in the end she told me sometimes we really have to white knuckle through something found it frustrating like wanted her to give me better way but no one can do the actual work but you ve managed to get one of the most critical things done at work and it was relief not out of the woods by any means but at least managed to finally do something hope things get better for you and you find way sorry for the extra long post lol but know youre not the only one struggling with this

broken and tired suicide always on my mind how do cure my depression,could it be possible that your conscious mind and subconscious mind are in direct conflict with one another part of you is saying you believe you need to suffer on your own but then you say you dont believe it should last as long as it should would say you might be onto something in that sentence because you could have said dont believe it should last as long as it does but instead you chose the word should which indicates you just switched your mindset mid sentence could it be your feeling guilty about how long it is lasting but also helpless at the same time wish could give better advice asides from the fact you could be having some internal argument but myself feel depressed due to the fact that dont feel sexually desirable by anyone would say this though focus on the words you use because they map out clues to where the actual problem lies not sure if this is enough for resolution but it certainly is start and all good things need to start somewhere would also like to add that high paying job is not something that we can get its something that is given to us so if can convince someone to like me and ve seen it before it really doesnt matter what skills have oh they will train me no problem and that goes for anyone for the most part would spend some time and think about the original post not in depressing way but in critical way asking questions to the choice of words because believe none of this is written by accident and theres more to it that might get revealed each day so maybe come back to it on good day on bad day and read it over maybe make notes observations connections
just some thoughts,can relate to your post strongly it really hard to not think you re being burden one way to help with this is trying therapy have you tried this before personally haven and know should but it scares the shit out of me for various reasons know it helps so many people and doing this allows you to talk to someone and know that you aren being burden just an idea know always feel like burden on the people around me and that why want to do therapy can say you aren burden and have the classic answer however me saying you aren burden won help you know the feeling talking to someone who is trained may be able to help

is it normal that my appetite changes while being depressed,fluctuations in appetite is definitely normal there are days when even look at foods that know are delicious but cant bring myself to even think of eating it just feels like to eat will take more energy then has ever existed in my body days where you dont feel like you can stomach anything are tough days because the lack of energy creates depressive feedback loop youre depressed so youre not hungry youre not hungry so you dont eat which means you have less energy which increases those oppressive draining feelings have two suggestions first on the days where you feel like you cant eat anything still try to drink lot of water if your body is hydrated then it will make those hunger pangs more poignant to the point that they might override your aversion to food second my friend gave me the bare minimum advice for daily depression maintenance when it comes to eating try to eat fist full of protein day be it from nuts meats beans etc found that the easiest way to accomplish this is to get some chocolate flavored protein powder some powdered peanut butter and mix up simple chocolate pb smoothie those are pretty easy to force down and the sweetness will activate some of your brains serotonin receptors so you might not feel as down afterward good luck living with depression is very difficult at times if you take tiny steps each day even if you think youre taking steps backward youre still moving and flowing in your own time believe in you

someone please read this and help,hey there thanks for writing everything out and explaining your situation and for reaching out it does sound like you have lot going on with studies and your volunteer work if you dont mind me asking what are you studying and what is your favourite part of the degree it also sounds like youre very driven individual who has very high standards for yourself this can be good as it means that youre constantly pushing yourself to do better but its important to take step back occasionally and look at how much you have achieved and take stock of the great strides youre making towards your goals like your degree or job it can be rather challenging to balance everything and exhaustion and burnout are real concerns how has your sleep been through all of this with lockdown and social distancing restrictions lack of sleep can exacerbate other health conditions like depression and anxiety can imagine that social distancing doesnt work so well for someone who enjoys the company of others have you been able to chat with friends using discord and other voice video chat services while we cant see people in real life seeing them even across computer screen can be really beneficial for our mental well being during these lockdown times how long have you been on sertraline and is it your first time taking an anti depressant your psychiatrist would have spoken to you about how long it would take for the drug to start working and whether it is the correct medication for you unfortunately dont have any experience with eds but would definitely mention it to your psychiatrist primary physician not eating enough might have other impacts on your energy levels and the efficacy of the anti depressant

feeling really lost,hey always hated studying too and learned to hate college near the end didnt go to grad school and gave up on my career path although thats mostly because lost interest in it once got better idea of what it would entail ironically since then ve actually developed better study habits if youre having trouble just getting started due to feeling overwhelmed by how much work there is just kind of look downward bit look at what content is right in front of you and focus on that you said you have friends doing better than you right ask them what they do they might have strats you could use yourself do you study by just reading and re readimg things and hoping to understand try more active methods of learning write things down the simple act of writing things down helps keep them in mind flash cards can be tremendously helpful for learning and retaining information ask your friends if they would be willing to share their notes and stuff with you if your textbook came with practice quizzes and tests take them look up practice tests and the like for your subject online as well ask your professor about concepts you dont understand working through problems with professional can be enlightening ask if theres anything you can do to help them or others in your field of study gres and grades arent the only things grad schools take into consideration if youre helpful reliable person then professors will want you around go for understanding not rote memorization some memorization is unavoidable but if you really understand the subject yourself you should be able to figure out concepts on the fly even if you didnt memorize them in advance if you come across something you dont know on test think about what you do know and see if you can figure out solution from there begin studying any given subject long before big tests or essays are due you want to do this because taking breaks and resting is important for retaining knowledge too you want to study slow and steady not cram the night before cant give more specific advice without knowing what youre studying but hope that helps

not sure how to approach certain situation,hi there first off think its great that youre open to talking about these things certainly wasnt when was your age and it took me long time to get to that point first recommend finding support group dont know of any for youth off the top of my head but you can contact nami national alliance on mental illness to see if there are any for folks your age in your area hearing from people who at least kind of get it is very powerful experience also as far as approaches to therapy go wonder if youd like dialectical behavioral therapy dbt which is centered around identifying challenging and ultimately replacing intrusive thoughts and negative coping strategies theres lot of written work you can do on your own and then some that you go over with therapist or friend best wishes

ive been struggling recently,hi gmxball what are these thoughts on your mind that you feel have been affecting your mental state we look upon our parental figures to guide us in life but not everyone is suited for every situation the great thing about life is that our environment upbringing and experiences shape who we are as person no matter the age we are always learning and developing as person youre years old you have many great and wonderful years ahead of you that you have yet to experience imagine all the friends lovers and acquaintances that is out there waiting for you to one day enter into their lives many decades older than you but wake up everyday and look at the world as challenge what can accomplish today and what can do to give myself that satisfaction of accomplishment sometime end my day feeling defeated but know tomorrow is another day and another chance to do it all over agian with the experience gain from the day before if you tried talking to your mother and she wasnt the right fit for your situation dont feel defeated try talking to someone else other relatives perhaps counselor pastor at church or any religious figure
plagued by demons,look idk if this helps but wanted to die many times sometimes still do what always stopped me was something read here story of woman whos husband committed suicide they had baby and she was completely destroyed by the situation in the end she says she now had lot of legal issues and she was left alone always think about this because when we are depressed we think theres no one who cares no consequences that were alone the truth is that we live in society around lot of people there are no possibilities that youre completely alone in this world your death always will make an impact on someone friends family co workers classmates neighbors etc for me it always has been suffering having to live life while being depressed its the worst but again there are billions of people at there theres no way were completely alone
here if you need to vent,feeling so empty today dont feel anything and its scary be scared shitless if wasnt so numb
how well does medication work,its not simple answer of if they do or dont work well everyone has different physiology so medications work differently for everyone what might work well for one person experiencing something might have no effect or bad effect on someone else experiencing the same symptom but its definitely worth try to find out the best thing to do is get diagnosis from psychologist or psychiatrist and keep an open mind to trying multiple medications dont go to your general practitioner for medication because they aren certified in medication management its not simple or quick process but if you think you need medication its very important you try and find good match for you if you want any advice for trying medications im happy to help have lot of experience in this area hope this helps at all
how do help myself what can do to stop my depression cycle and make my brain stop attacking me,my wife also battles with depression we have talked multiple times about her seeing therapist and weve even mentioned going to counseling for couples know how hard it is to see her when shes at her worst her medication does help though her and her doctor have worked hard at getting her dose just right think that we as people in general get too consumed with finding the cure or the fix and we shouldnt in my opinion there is nothing to fix just something to learn from there is something in your past just like my wife that not just needs to be confronted but also needs to be accepted please dont take that the wrong way we cant change our past but we can accept the fact that we are who we are because of our past we can choose to let or past weaken us or we can choose to embrace who we have become individually and allow our past to strengthen us truly hope this helps only wish you the best

feel worthless and hate myself,healing is something that has to be actively worked on it not easy it takes lot of work and digs up lot of pain it means looking at every bit of the past and present it takes getting to know yourself and your reactions and your triggers and the why of each one getting to know every inch the light the dark every shade of grey it is not easy but it is possible can say if there ever an okay healed enough maybe this is lifelong battle still in the start of mine but do feel like ve gotten some better even if still trip and fall sometimes it takes great conscious effort catch yourself doing it ask the why ask the where and then do the inverse explain to yourself why those thoughts are lying to you list the good things about you think about the things you like think about the things you want from the future think about the steps you can do to do them it going to be hard and uncomfortable and you won always be able to but stick it through when you are able you can totally do it

help getting through the holidays,look understand what that can be like but the best way ve found to avoid substance abuse and self harm is by surrounding yourself with people that love and care about you found out that by doing this dont want to change the way they see me dont want them to dislike me try to be the person that they see me as so try and show them that can be that person the virus may make it different for most people but if have literally anybody that looks up to you or supports you through your trials spend as much time as possible with them avoid being anywhere alone

these few days obsessed with an idea of ordering whole pizza and chowing down it all alone in my room,go through something similar and need to take notice of it before things go south for me when more depressed than usual have craving for cheese before my last hospitalization ate half of lasagna by myself apparently there is some science behind this when your serotonin is low you crave dairy to increase tryptophan its precursor to serotonin so your body is trying to replace what you are low on now usually ask for med adjustment if find myself wanting cheese with every meal good luck

have no idea what doing with my life,until did ancestrydna was positive was in the wrong ing family think depression and anxiety wrote most of your post if you re open to medication find psychiatrist who will fight for you when you re not able to ssri and snri are all the rage but not right for everyone drug reps stock doctors offices with samples and docs think giving you free meds is good thing and it is if that the drugs you need after yrs being prescribed one or the other and going deeper and deeper into world of depression started educating myself found class of meds that were different talked to my doctor about it and he was happy to try it for the last month ve been waking up from the three year stupor ve been in also write lot keep journals handy to write my feelings out that way when feeling positive can read the things wrote when was sad it helps me learn to be little nicer to myself if you don have cheerleader be your own when you shower for the first time in week congratulate yourself try to find an award system you can do for yourself don measure your worth by other people most of what people share is fake anyway you ll find your path you ll find your people you ll find your happiness just because it hasn happened in the same timeline as others doesn mean it isn going to happen truly hope you find help to move forward and know that you have cheerleader rooting for you
the longer go on the less feel human,you are ok depression and ptsd are hard to work thru however depression can be overcome it is process to work thru and it will take time there are meds to take and the right one may take some trial and error for you til you find the right one for you believe in yourself you were created with purpose you have talents focus on the positive and productive activities redirect your thoughts try not drinking caffiene or pop no spicy or sugary foods listen to soothing calming music go for walk drink water take shower read book journal these things do help sending encouragement
how do know if actually depressed,have depression anxiety and ptsd depression doesnt mean youre never able to feel happiness or joy there are days that feel somewhat decent and there are moments when feel genuinely happy depression can be very complicated and thats okay everything youre feeling is valid people can experience depressive episodes without having clinical depression too it doesnt mean it feels any less shitty understand you cant afford therapy though it might be in your best interest to seek out free counseling maybe through school or online services like betterhelp best wishes
ive ran out of options,hi sorry youre going thru all that that is lot to go thru all at once ve got cptsd so totally get the having bad memories flashbacks would suggest to see counselor if you are able they can really help for me these are some things that do that are helping me journaling what feeling what doing bad memories good memories etc grounding skills square breathing breath in for like seconds then hold for the same amount of time then breath out for the same amount of time breathing breath in for second hold for seconds breath out for seconds counting to then back to have more but those are the main ones use listening to music this is all from my personal experience and dont know if it will help

really need some help,first of all super sorry this is what is happening definitely not very qualified to give advice and anything say would make me hypocrite but since no one has commented yet just wanted to offer my support and let you know that there are people out there who hear you and wish they could help as far as conveying what you are feeling to parents understand how hard that must be im not sure what your relationship is but sometimes when people want someone to be happy and love them so much it hard to realize when they are in pain since don know them couldn guarantee that they would be receptive to you trying to explain it but likely there is more risk of further harm if you don tell them than if you do cue the hypocrisy really really wish you didn feel alone and unwanted and really wish could reach through the screen and be there for you what ve been feeling is definitely not as serious so my range of tips are limited but would recommend finding something simple that can always just add little bit of happiness back into your life maybe it one of your favorite things or specific video game as you mentioned for me just have one song that would play when in tough spot and that would never fail to put at least slight smile on my face by the end that song is sunnier days by diego garcia honestly not sure why that song it not like my favorite song or anything it not like it has gone down as the song of the century or anything but it makes me happy but that first time it worked guess it just became little symbol of hope so if you have something just one thing that can make you happy would hold onto that sorry this really turned into something long when was really just trying to offer support again would definitely be hypocrite giving advice and really don know any of the answers myself just wanted to let you know that there are people out there and feeling alone can last forever there is always someone out there rooting for you
thinking about getting antidepressants should,if you never tried them before would recommend asking professional about it no harm in trying and seeing if meds would help just note that you may need to try different kinds of anti depressants at different dosages before you find one that you like and also most antidepressants take bunch of weeks before you can see their effects on your depression you can always stop in safe manner if you decide antidepressants are not for you it also seems like most ppl who benefit from antidepressants use it to gain better function in life it doesn completely take away the depression just makes it easier to take care of yourself and carry out your adult responsibilities
do you struggle with emotional numbness and can grieve correctly for real death but still cry from tv,hey im just going to put my personal experience with numbness here used to beat myself up for not feeling emotions for my boyfriend but once was on break from school they suddenly flooded back its like my anxiety choked it out maybe your brain is shutting and disassociating from the grief to protect you think you should just accept that you dont feel strong emotions didnt feel this way for my cousin grandma didnt know her but was there for my cousin yknow so try to focus on what youre doing to comfort others and keep others safe hope that helps
failing in everything,dont know what you want to be said to you maybe you just needed to get that out of your system if thats the case this comment is worthless didnt like school growing up so didnt really studied or cared now work and study after work it took me long time to sign the paper and go to school again because didnt had any motivation though it was worthless was ready to do meaningless dull job for the rest of my life like squidward got in my head be profissional to the best of my abilities do my job the best could would appreciate it the most could make people have good time around me at work and appreciate even more the time wasnt in there doing it finishing school in january ll probably take steel engineering or maybe wont dont know what course to take the problem here is just one you want good job after you finish school but you wont appreciate the job either because was something you didnt like and you think youll appreciate the money the problem is that more and more people are coming with the same mentality bad professionals in various areas are now pilling everywhere you have to find what youd like to do something that money would be plus dont really know what to say but even if you pass all the academic hardships youll probably find greater hardship even more difficult one because it doesnt have an expiration date thats called carrear in something you never liked doing it because of the money it provides living for expensive vacations great house and the sad part is that those kind of jobs take most of your time require great responsibility and lots of stress
lost my job and everyone in my family including my husband believes its good thing everyone seems to think that can just find job that will let me work flexible hours because cannot afford childcare and am the only one who can and will take care of the kids everyday,im writing this not because can solve everything but because want to support you in these times cant find anything and want to let you know was one of the few people that saw this and commented anything hope the best for you and cant do anything becaude im and hella depressed but wanna help with something wish can give you money outta thin air to help you but cant hope the best for you and that you can make it past these trying timss
being happy brings out the real dark side of my depression and think it has made me afraid of happiness,definitely feel you on this it can feel easier to stay in perpetual state of sadness than to go through rollercoaster of high highs and low lows what helped me are thought stopping techniques learned from therapist so when experiencing positive moment and negative thought interrupts it counter that negative thought with logic and reasoning because although our emotions are valid and real they may not always come from reasonable places for example this is pretty nice but it won last so it doesn matter or why bother with this if you ll just be sad later if it doesn last then that okay just glad it happened and hope to have more moments like this in the future thoughts like these help me stay grounded and focused on the joyful experience rather than have it soured by sadness

what to do or say when your significant other says things like they don want to live anymore,hey thats really nice of you to care about her like that sure she is so glad to have you in her life dont really know what the best thing to do for her is but everyone usually recommends therapy and think that might be best to recommend here too since they can work with her through her specific situation and it gives you more breathing room might be hard when it comes to covid restrictions or money though other than that would think just keep doing what youre doing be support for her and have non judgemental acceptance of her thoughts and feelings give her hope that shell get better but yeah take care of yourself first because you cant help her if you hurt yourself in the process
my year old daughter is depressed any tips,first of all you are wonderful parent for being so supportive and understanding of your daughter that in itself will make huge difference went through similar feelings starting at that age and made my way to unhealthy coping mechanisms because didn have any healthy outlet encouraging journaling or some creative outlet where she can express what she feeling in way that doesn have to be verbally can help depression is so hard to put into words that ve found this would ve helped me at that age have found that physical activity keeps my depression at bay and did when was that age too maybe finding sport or even going on little hikes or walks with your daughter could help little hikes could keep things interesting too instead of standard walk overall know my biggest desire at that age being depressed was knowing someone was listening and not necessarily fully understanding because that became frustrating to hear as no one can fully understand you and what you re feeling except yourself but someone to listen to me in non judgement and safe space big emphasis on non judgmental because depression can cause lot of shame and confusion being judgmental towards that person and what they re going through just exacerbates things further don show judgement on how she might want to cope some days she may want day in bed or doesn want to push herself so hard that okay it not lazy it listening to her body and slowly moving towards feeling better sometimes don even want to do things normally enjoy especially when depressed nothing seems enjoyable always remember there is no overnight cure it giving her the tools and support to help her navigate her depression in healthy way hope this helps and makes some sense please feel free to dm me with any questions or anything else you might need you and your daughter will get through this with supportive parent like you trying to understand and find sources you re already ahead of the game it would ve been wonderful to have parent like that in my life when was that age going through something similar now and finally learning to balance depression on my own having someone supportive and open would ve made this process so much better edit also the question what wrong is really hard one to ask someone who is depressed it always stumps me and makes me more frustrated because sometimes don know what wrong or why feel the way do recommend refraining from asking your daughter and similar questions that could elicit the same feelings instead there questions like this how can best support you right now did something happen to make you feel this way or is it just one of those off days are you worrying about anything right now

how to get over the tiredness,hey this is common symptom for the corona virus severe lethargy have you been tested
dont have anything enjoy or look forward to in life and genuinely am just tired of being alive,hey friend just wanted to say read your post and care about how you re doing and feeling ve been through severe depressive period as well where didn want to do anything with my life it tough to get out of but rest assured there is hope and there are solutions so here are the steps took to get better and maybe they will help you too identify what the problem is for me depression was feeling empty without understanding why for some people it can be obvious like maybe they lost their job or their bf gf broke up with them but sometimes it chemical imbalance in the brain and if that the case it not your fault you didn do anything wrong and you ve probably heard this million times but antidepressants may help some people as well as talk therapy this stuff can be expensive but there this website ve used before called openpathcollective org where the therapists there can charge more than session so maybe that an option for you set teeny tiny goals and follow through with them this will help to raise your self esteem slowly it could even be things like taking shower one day and then walking around the block the next day try journaling have found this to be useful tool to brain dump how feeling and it feels good to get it all out on paper start moving your attention away from the fact that you re depressed if you keep actively focusing on it then you re feeding the cycle of depression this worked for me it difficult at first but it may help to rewire your thought patterns to start focusing on other things daily mindfulness meditation practices also help lot with this think lot of what depression is is feeling empty with lack of purpose previously tried to find purpose in all these different hobbies and nothing worked so kinda just said well instead of me trying to find purpose in something like writing or photography ll refocus my energy to helping someone else and that helped immensely it took my mind off of depression was able to make someone else day and it left me feeling very fulfilled as human being idk if any of this will help but hope some of it does stay strong friend and if you ever wanna vent will listen

just another day,sorry you are feeling so poorly and going through this right now if it helps at all maybe just to help you not feel so alone one of my worst depressive episodes so far was in college and the rates for college students with depression found out later are actually pretty high can understand not being completely honest with therapist if they are not helping you have done the same thing before basically because wanted to spare his her feelings because they were not helping want to make point of saying that find it bit unusual for therapist or doctor to tell you that you should be feeling better as depression is different for every person even though some of the symptoms can be the same also just because you are on meds and going to therapy doesn mean you will necessarily feel better depending on if the meds you are taking actually work for you how long your episode lasts how severe it is and whether or not your therapist is actually good at his her job lol feel like he or she is kind of failing you in this regard by being bit dismissive and telling you how you should be feeling it could be time to look at finding different therapist doctor if this one is not good match and is not helpful to you am in pretty dark place myself right now so you are definitely not alone even though you might feel that way right now if you are having trouble affording therapy or meds you might want to look into applying for medicaid if it is available where you live as it can help pay for the cost of both would also suggest looking for free therapy resources or therapist that works on sliding scale cost is dependent on your income those types of resources can often be found through your local social services department depending on other people resources for help is not something typically like doing but sometimes you just have to do what you have to do when you need help pulling yourself out not always great socially so hope my comments don come off the wrong way just wanted to offer some support as know how exhausting it is to be in that hole and feel like you don know when it will get better hope you can find something that will help soon and that can at least offer some momentary solace hope you feel better soon
no enjoyment in life at all,wonder what god would say about the efforts you keep putting in to move forward even when things are so hard
messed up dream job interview,heya really sorry about your interview and about the toxic relationship but glad youre out of it it sounds like you are having very hard time get it this is tough year regardless but it really seems like youve been suffering some severe depression and hope this helps had no direction through my teens twenties and early thirties was working meaningless minimum wage jobs and quitting when got too depressed and stopped caring an artist and writer and when was younger thought that my path would follow those went to college and got few degrees as backup but didnt follow through with either path and wasnt happy making money with my art or writing to me making money removed the passion tried moving into my own apartment to get new start but my mom guilted me into coming with as she was losing the house after my dad died anyway so was stuck with the same shit been running from working without passion and falling deeper into depression and was so miserable that didnt recognize myself and looking back to that time in my life now can see that was passively suicidal but when was got call from job never would have imagined was my dream job because it was so far from the ideas had for myself now and have been working at my dream job for two years come july it gave me the opportunity to move away and making enough money now to live comfortably guess my point is that the dream job now might not be the dream job in the future youve gotta hang on for the next dream come true because you never know what will come the position youre in right now is not forever promise feel better my friend

how to get motivated while being depressed from isolation,already had mild depression before covid and the pandemic has made it worse the onset of cold weather doesn help either what seems to help make basic physical and emotional needs the first priority especially if there is any concern of developing severe depression esp the sleep all day kind make it priority to eat fairly healthy get good sleep get some amount of exercise go outside sometimes get dressed keep your living space non gross interact daily with any friends or others online etc this will give you better and more stable baseline to work with make plan for addressing any major weaknesses that you may have in terms of self care get telehealth therapy if you are interested in professional help for me do better at motivation when have long term post covid plans and goals to strive for may not feel like doing the tasks involved but it does feel good to do my daily time investments or planned daily weekly baby steps toward those long term plans and goals sometimes start task or activity without feeling motivated but the act of starting something is enough to trigger some working amount of motivation make and stick to daily schedule doesn have to be all day or complicated or productive just create some routines if you don have one lower your expectations of life during the pandemic you likely won have your happiest or productive years for bit lots of people are struggling right now it normal do the best you can to take care of yourself and live your life despite the depressive feelings
just need some advice or help guess,hi first of all keep in mind that this voice is your own voice and it would never gonna go away you dont have to fight against it you have to learn how to live with it its hard not gonna lie but you could start with some little stepts for example have very low autoestim and when someone compliments me my inner voice start with this guy girl is lying to you youre not pretty youre ugly he she is mocking you well started to ignore it and just say thank you to the ones who compliments me and it work most of the time at least didnt hear the inner voice is like it gets tired of me ignoring it so it find another ways to ck me but not with that you should get some confidence of yourself maybe you arent like your friends but that is fine have friends who are very different from me and that doesnt mean dont deserve them eg one of them is very intelligent guy always gets grades more grade but thats fine if you do your best and learn to your own time its great you could ask your friends why are your friends and they would tell you and then you could see its nothing related to grades or same fields etc little last advice go and see therapist good luck
think about suicide too often and thing the end of my relationship may be the end for me,your situation sounds lot like me years ago was struggling lot with depression had year relationship that was long distance for the last years that was starting to fail was thinking about suicide lot and was on antidepressants and in therapy even though was chasing my dream career in wonderful city felt overwhelmed and alone and was sad all the time could feel the relationship breaking and it felt like my girlfriend was the only thing that was really good in my life so gave up my job and moved to her state to save the relationship mistake was too late few months later she dumped me years down the drain just like that it felt like had lost everything felt betrayed abandoned empty and worthless didnt do much for several months except cry sleep and try to figure out how it all went wrong and how to win her back thank god for my family or likely wouldnt be around to write this comment eventually picked myself up enough to move back and start chasing my dream again wasnt happy about it at all but did it anyway that was year and half ago still dealing with depression still feeling hurt and alone still have days when wake up from dream about my ex and cant help but cry over everything ve lost theres still times when all can think is that broken ll never be happy again and dont deserve to be anyway but ve learned that even without her even with depression theres life worth living theres little tiny pieces of joy to be found if you can look past the overwhelming sadness theres meaning and value in human existence even if its suffering still dont like my life still dont much like myself but might someday and going to stick around to find out sharing this story to tell you few things one fight for your mental health get professional help if you can keep your family and friends close if they are good people and care about you most likely they will save your life two fight for your relationship even if it feels like you cant do anything right dont become defeatist dont accept the illusion that things cant get better if you fall victim to that thinking itll become self fulfilling prophecy and youll hate yourself for it three and most important even if the relationship does end its not the end for you many times before my breakup felt things could be going that way and it was almost comforting in sick way like once she was gone could finally just go through with it and stop the suffering like she would be better off and could rid the world of my contemptible existence win win but those are just thoughts the mad ravings of diseased brain thoughts can change so can feelings even if it feels like they wont they can basically your worst case scenario here and telling you youre going to make it good luck
it still hurts that she chose someone else over me with all the love have given how do move on from that am unable to hate her,hi im sorry about what ur going through have had my fair share of toxic relationships in the past sometimes when you are with someone all you see is the good in them and your brain just blocks out the bad until time passes and you reflect and realize how they really treated you know everyone says this but time really does help you are unable to hate her now but your emotions will change as time goes and there will be new people to meet along the way the pain is bad at first but promise it will go away and you will find someone who you deserve to be with and treats you right also remember to love yourself first too everything will work out

have no one to vent to,have tried polyamory and monogamy and what concluded is this monogamy has greater tendency towards stability monogamy lets you focus and dig and find more depth in the love for the other person polyamory allows you to vent better you emotions as you can choose which person pays you better attention polyamory lets you have better sex because you dont have to wait on the other person nor you have to resolve any current problems to advance in the intimacy polyamory creates this power positions because nromally there is one person that has more access to partners making the person with less access feel more pressured and less emotionally stable monogamy is kind of boring because it is not derived from constant change but constant order as you can tell not fan of polyamory because in the end everyone gets hurt

could have depression,aw that was me felt tired and procrastinated im trying to fix it and doing pretty okay now wish you the best
is this all my life is,depression is horrible disease it convinces you that you re worthless and burden and that life isn worth it you need to remember that these thoughts are not you they re your disease ve been battling depression over half my life it taken family friends therapists psychiatrists and meds but can guarantee things get better sure your mother loves you dearly and does not see you as burden keep up with your meds and medical care sometimes therapy works great sometimes not personally like just talking to my psychiatrist times year and taking medication over therapy some people are the opposite you ll find what right for you it takes some shopping around but it worth the effort self care is also important try doing one nice thing for yourself each day watch show you like read or look at hobbies staying busy is great strategy you ve got this you really do

living with depressed parent,hey my mom also has severe mental health problem and understand how hard this is for you you are very brave and it is lucky for her to have you in her life for me it is change of perspective that helps me live with this reality often see my mom as person who is sick just like everybody else with cancer diabetes heart problems you name it depression is very tricky because its symptoms are reflected in persons behaviour and mind not the body and so we often think it is possible for person to feel better and try harder because human can control their mind and behaviours when in fact people with depression arent actually able to like we dont tell asthma patients to feel better without giving them treatment and helping them thats the scary part of depression the illness ruled their mind and soul you mentioned how she is unwilling to help herself it is simply because she cant and she doesnt know how to get out of there my way of handling my moms problem is to give her something to live for my mom is really looking forward to seeing me become mother one day and that is what keeps her alive and always tell her to wait for that day to come and am eager to have her participating in my future what also do is that started exchanging one thing that happened today made me happy grateful with her it was really really hard for her to come up with such small thing at the beginning but dont stop encouraging her give her example like dont you think brushing your teeth today make you feel good am so happy to hear you took your med today it sounds stupid to even cheer for such little things but thats exactly what they need simply positive reinforcement to help them get back to normal and start to appreciate the smallest thing around them just like how we dont give up on an asthma patient when he she having an attack dont give up on her having her low moments either even though they happen all the time all these little things work for me because she started to try to take care of herself and am not saying its easy because too because of constantly worrying her her being constantly failing started to feel depressed and hopeless it is an extremely hard battle harder than anything that encountered and will encounter just remember it is the illness that steps between you and her and you are not fighting each other but the illness depression patients always have better treatment outcome when there is are someone supportive in their life and its true let them know its okay to feel sad sluggish and dont punish them for misbehaving instead only reward their good behaviours with positive responses am proud of you because am really happy to hear you you did great thing taking care of yourself even though they are deep in dark place they can still feel love and encouragement and you are doing great because you are not giving up yet even though we are complete strangers am still very very proud of you for your choice of moving back and helping her

as friend of someone with depression what the best way to show your support and help,everyones experience is different but for me the best things my friends can do is just listen grew up not feeling heard and when people actually seem to hear me instead of waiting for their turn to talk really helps let your friend know youre there for them but if they need space give them space sometimes dealing with other people even those love is too draining when trying to take care of myself for example but really if they opened up to you about it they trust you and you probably have been listening already so youre doing just fine best of luck to you both

tips on how to get out of depressive episode,don really have any advice but in the same boat hope you get some answers
think am depressed but dont understand why or how to fix it,dont want to diagnose you ofc but that sounds like youre having really tough time yes was difficult and stressful year so its plausible to feel down or depressed for no particular reason assume we all experience accumulation of minor and major issues right now lockdowns are limiting our social life there are ton of bad news in the media rn many people seem way more agressive nowadays and fight over conspiracy politics covid and so on also as far as know depression isnt necessarily the result of sad events or unfulfilled life its more like disease that is often triggered or amplified by such things so even if youre living fantastic and flawless life its possible to get depressed due to genetics hormonal factors

ashamed to be part of my family,as someone who has cut off most of her family for the same reason when you can cut them off completely and never look back you feeling this way is proof that you may look like them and share blood with them but you are nothing like them and you are not waste of person you can see how toxic they are and you strive not to be like that this alone means you re very different from them hang on to that the more you disassociate with them and start building your own family friends and people who you love people you chose to have in your life the more you will see how different you are from your family it hurts my heart that you hate the way you look because you look like your mom hopefully one day after much therapy yes you need therapy being around toxic people is toxic to your brain and love from the family you built you will see that you re beautiful you can make it through this just give it time and be patient with yourself you re worth it
any tips on how to build up courage to tell someone you have depression would love some help,don know what the relationship is to the person you want to tell but ll try to give my best advice know it seems really scary to tell this person but it is also very important and will probably feel very good that does depend on their reaction obviously but if they react in bad way would say this isn someone you want in your life friend family member partner let call it person should try to understand and be supportive good person will appreciate you telling them because it is huge compliment to be trusted with such an important subject that you may feel ashamed of so don think of it as being burden think of it like doing someone favour or giving them gift that my best advice not the best at it
can do anything without thinking about how it all going to end and how everything is just impending doom and depression,sorry youre going through this think its important we really take the time to put into perspective where our thoughts are at and what we spend time thinking about it sounds like youve done that and realize its not exactly serving you well but the more important step comes next where we start doing the work to replace those thoughts with things that are good true and loving as humans we have the free will to think and do nearly anything but that doesnt make anything and everything good for us as someone who really has struggled with anxiety there came point where realized could continue letting these anxious thoughts debilitate me or could start trying to catch them as they come in and figure out if they were good true and right before let them settle in my mind know its bit abstract but ll leave you with some verses that really started studying and meditating on theyve helped me tremendously whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things philippians everything is permissible but not everything is helpful everything is permissible but not everything builds up corinthians so yes most things do come to an end eventually but does that thought build you or those around you up what could you replace that thought with that would not only be true but also good noble and lovely what about thankfulness for where youre at in that exact moment that you get to experience this right now or vocalizing to the friend or dog that you love them and are grateful for them in your life maybe kind gesture to show it whatever that is for you hope youre able to see that you have more control than you think over these thoughts of yours wishing you all the best friend
can you have depression even when you don have suicidal thoughts,oh yes you can be depressed or anxious without being suicidal
what makes you stay,the guy used to date for only two months has depression for one year now it started november last year tbh don think there is anything you could say that stops the bad thoughts they need professional help since the start of his depression he has been pushing me away because he didn feel anything anymore he didn enjoy anything anymore and he just didn care kept texting him despite that because knéw that just wasn him he was sick and he really appreciated that stayed eventhough he never told me back then all he did was ignore me or respond very late he has been on meds now for almost year it slowly very slowly starting to get better corona isn helping either he lost many friends because they just couldn understand what was happening to him he blocked almost everyone on whatsapp they thought he is an asshole which he truly isn it was very hard for me too because people kept telling me to stop texting him he got into fight on his best friend birthday party and he threw pillows when people visited him at his place he was totally off so conclusion if you really want to do this it can get very hard mentally nd emotionally try to be there for him or her ask him what he needs and what he needs if he she doesn respond accept that and try again one or two weeks later make him her know that no matter what you will always be there and prove it try to educate yourself about depression try to get him her out for walk but leave him her alone when he she needs rest send funny wholesome meme tell him her how much he she means to you ask about university college and if there is anything you could do to help maybe send some summaries if you study the same subject well that all that came to my mind now if you need some more advice or anything you can always send me message take care edit he also told me he thought he didn deserve me and that would be better off with someone else
how to find motivation when you ve fallen into depression for the umpteenth time,its really hard when you realize you havent been making progress recently at least what you view as progress recovery is unfortunately not always upward sometimes you might get tired or emotionally exhausted and not be able to do anything but exist for the past few weeks just want to sleep after work only this week have had bit of energy to do stuff after work like play game or go for walk self hatred makes you really tired as well because you are constantly battling your mind think my medication kind of smooths over my thoughts bit so dont feel that harsh emotional pain all the time and it makes it easier to manage might contact your gp to ask about increase change in medication and or contact at therapist of course am not an expert my therapist has told me to accept these feelings and give myself time to mope rest or whatever because might be very emotionally tired then when am ready try to do something small and reward yourself when you do it breaking stuff into steps really helps write lists on my phone if the first step is too hard then the step is too big recovery is marathon not sprint take care and be kind to yourself
depressed so advice,the way you talk about your so is so demeaning it sounds like you don even like them maybe check yourself talk to them ask why they feel this way if there anything you can do to help etc then if your so truly is depressed which it for sure sounds like you ll have to stick around and be their support system and be there for the highs and lows the good and bad days if you re not down for all of that leave it not fair to them to have half assed support system who only there when they feel like it
be honest based on my life details would be better off dead,hey read all of it so let me write you what think and give you some of my experience first off you seem like sweet and caring guy virginity is straight up bullshit someone once made it up to look cool its not cool if you have sex with anything and everyone people arent toys you arent more or less of person if you had sex in my opinion you only have sex with someone you really love if you didnt find that person yet then its fine youll find her one day dont worry about it second am so sorry your parents were strict to you and that you had to go through all that understand your anger and understand lots of people lack empathy but there are also still good people on this world at least try to believe that the guy used to date for two months last year got depressed aswel its been year now he doesnt think he deserves me and he keeps pushing me away but during this year learned lot about mental illnesses and the way people look at mentally ill people they cant understand and tbh dont blame them its not like he broke leg or something you cant see it he seems fine on the outside he posts on socials he smiles but deep down he is numb and sad and lonely and dead many people told me to leave him be and stop texting him but know am the only one who still cares about him and am not planning to leave him ever look everyone always has opinion about things but in the end you shouldnt listen to them just follow your own heart so if you dont like your job maybe try something else if you would like boxing but its too expensive try to buy your own boxing set and practice at home mean why not to answer your final question yes of course your life is worth living its your life after all and you decide what you want to do with it don ever let anyone bring you down everyone has opinions and even if you would do everything right there will still be people that dont like you thats how this world is please dont kill yourself you seem like one of the people who actually make this world better place you can see all the wrongs that others seem to ignore your parents werent very good to you but you could do better and make great dad yourself dont waste your money on hookers though instead buy yourself car and slowly start to build up your life try to find some hobbies and meet your friends the girl will come oh and btw there is nothing weird with mental illnesses or taking medicine you arent broken you just need time take it easy my friend maybe write down how you feel in journal and whenever you need to talk send me message

just gotta get this out there,so theres the short term and long term of it in the short term you should probably get yourself some medicine and therapist because you seem to be using media to shut out intrusive thoughts and feelings and arent able to function well if you feel like youre able to just drop anime and games if you found an interesting subject to work on disregard the above but used to do this for this specific purpose and therapy and medicine is what helped me do some stretching exercises daily if you have some access to yoga try doing that its more likely to help than not none of this is meant to get you into shape or anything stretching just releases endorphins and that might make your mood bit better maybe pick up mindfulness as practice if you can if your head fills with fog when you try to do this stop and leave it till you build up some resilience against intrusive thoughts dont pressure yourself to do things because you have to unless theyre important or cant be put off do try to get some sunlight daily in the long term figuring out whats up with you will help is it cptsd seasonal depression that kind of thing read books on the subject engage with people on the path to recovery from it understand the biases that youre likely to have in terms of behavior people and so forth sort them into healthy and unhealthy start working on them keeping in mind that some things require more time and effort than others and with some the best you can do is be cognizant of them decent exercise and diet regime and sleep schedule should fit in here among other habits you think are healthy this is what working on and what has proven effective for me

anyone who do drug therapy with escitaloprám,yes escitalopram is an ssri more commonly sold as lexapro it could take between month to two months before you notice an effect did escitalopram combined with cognitive behavior therapy for me personally the ssri might have taken the edge off but cbt helped me bit more because it helped me identify and start tackling the source of my issues
can decide if my meds are worth this struggle,therapy in combination with medication is the most aggressive and effective method for addressing depression stemming from trauma think of the meds as life preserver when you re still learning how to swim therapy in storm depression if you have that life preserver but you re not learning how to swim you re never going to make it to shore recovery you just float there if you re learning how to swim but you don have that life preserver sure you stay above the surface but you re tired from fighting the waves in the storm by using these tools in combination you have better chance of success try fluoxetine as your next med if you still feel you need to change but get into therapy asap

want to get better and need some serious advice,write down your thoughts journaling might sound like cheap trick but the mind is sneaky thing and if you dont pin down your thoughts in writing your mind will wriggle around them and youll eventually feel worse or stagnate try to get to the bottom of your thoughts for example if the thought going to fail this semester makes you feel bad you can ask yourself what would it mean if did fail this semester the answer to that is something you can work on suppose your answer is it would mean failure its harsh judgement but its only upsetting if you believe it to be true the point is once you get to the bottom line of what is upsetting you you can start questioning that thought would it be fair to call yourself failure if you were to fail this semester youve got good attitude going with wanting to get better you can do this keep going and best of luck

how am supposed to tell my parents that depressed,don wanna make any assumptions so correct me if wrong getting the idea that you sorta feel emotionally closed with your parents since they somewhat shut you down when you came to them to talk about your incident in the th grade you might not feel comfortable with telling them now that you re depressed because you believe they ll either shut you down or try to correct you for example possibly saying something like no you re not depressed it just teenager thing ve also been struggling with that and never rlly felt like could go to anyone to express myself because felt like just be nuisance or burden if were to vent my suggestion would be probably try to sit your parents down and talk to them about how you ve been feeling if it helps to just tell one of your parents then go for it too talked privately with my mom first since she seemed more likely to be able to understand what feeling and my struggles felt like my dad would think just weird or something since he was brought up very old school machismo toxic masculine he doesn really have good understanding of depression so in his eyes he thinks it me just being lazy or sad when reality it several other things like me feeling lonely hopeless and also getting mentally exhausted randomly

medication advice,well cipralex is an ssri so if you wanted to continue taking that type of medication zoloft would be best bet although zoloft from what ve heard from friends and my therapist is that it short term solution obviously it different for everyone but zoloft typically makes you feel really great fast and lasts few months but your body gets used to it and you turn numb withdrawals are also bitch and you might end up feeling worse than how you did before you started but that just what heard and you may react differently some people love it it treats variety of mental health issues pristiq haven heard of but it an snri which is similar to an ssri and is typically used just to treat depression cymbalta is another snri ve actually taken this one originally was on prozac and complained of side effects they tried this on me and the side effects were less but still there and didn like that perhaps should ve given it more time but know it wasn lingering side effects because was medication free for about year between prozac and cymbalta it used to treat depression and anxiety as well as conditions that cause pain like arthritis diabetes and fibromyalgia wellbutrin is what on at the moment and feel great it not an ssri or an snri so if you have uncomfortable side effects like did with medications like that than this make work well it also smoking cessation aid so if you re struggling to kick nicotine habit than this may be your best option didn choose this for the reason of quitting nicotine but noticed after that my habit was basically gone although newer to the habit so probably didn get as hooked as other besides this it has worked wonders for me take wellbutrin xl assuming you meant to write sr not sp but regardless personally recommend this one it also an stimulant free alternative medication for adhd which also helped me tremendously because was struggling with attention and impulsivity and was questioning whether had adhd couldn afford to get tested so that what sold me on this medication do take it along with buspar for my anxiety disorder and the two have changed my life for the better talk to you doctor relay to him or her your specific concerns whether your current or previous medication is helping you if you had any side effects you weren comfortable with etc they should be able to help you choose but if it simply because your medication has lost its effectiveness first try increasing the dose if it safe to do so or recommended by your doctor otherwise you can decide to go with similar kind of medication or something completely different go online and compare side effects and what the medication treats besides depression keep in mind that side effects are not guaranteed but neither is relief so don be afraid of the side effect list also look up how long the medications are supposed to take to kick in so you don become discouraged when you don immediately feel better but most of all just talk with you doctor and be as honest and straightforward as possible with your needs and concerns wish you look and hope you find relief soon

mess and don know how to deal,first of want to tell you everything got from your rant learned that youre an extremely brave and courageous person not only to have dealt with all that you have but to move to another stat after enduring rigorous and intense training camp that take lot of strength not to mention smarts you are extremely intelligent and it sounds like you are more than capable of doing anything you put your mind to just want to remind you of how valuable and important you are your capabilities are unique to you no one can work understand or articulate quite like you we all have unique way about us that impacts people in different ways and so your story and your voice are so important youve endured lot but promise it wont always be this way you will triumph again and life will be better than ever aside from your dream job which youve successfully attained have you considered other passions and actives that you enjoy ve found for me doing what love most helps me endure stressful and even painful moments as counterintuitive as it sounds giving back through volunteering or helping others has always ended up making me feel better challenge you during this very difficult time to think about and jot down the things you thoroughly enjoy what do you find joy in then challenge you to find ways to do just that it will help you more than you can imagine for me it was being around people and during time where was unemployed single and alone essentially felt extremely void of what love most so used my time and loneliness to actually help others that were lonely and even considered to some as outcasts in society volunteered more formally in soup kitchens and homeless shelters but also just spoke to the ones saw on the street asked them how their day was and they opened up to me about their life and childhood was glad to be an ear for them that day so they knew they were valuable and important and as down as was feeling doing that for them actually helped me feel better myself to challenge you to do the same write book even about what youve been though you could be helping many others who feel alone having gone through similar experience

in rare mode to talk about possibility of improving my life,work can be distracting but unless youre doing your dream job you work so that you can live not live so you can work societies like america and japan have work to the grave toxic cultural mentality you are more than your position see societies where they have more time off and paid vacations and youll see an overall mentally healthier people reserve time for yourself meditate self reflect take upon hobby we are social creatures yet some of us are more cat like than dog like extroverts we crave attention but become exhausted and cannot engage on topics that we dont find compelling loathe small talk however its necessity to navigate through social circles used to look down upon those who engage in small talk as of little imagination and ambition yet ve come to realize am the fool americans do not ask how are you because theyre interested in your day its meaningless greeting the code response is am fine how are you the more important thing is that it slides you into conversation and builds and immediate mood of mutual ground we cannot agree upon responsible fiscal policy for national progress yet hopefully we can agree the weather is how you say shitty if youre american or in an english speaking country effected by the toxic culture there are more things to consider theres an open hostility to the strange intellectual and foreign people dont talk about nerdy stuff until they better know you in public setting theyre less likely to do so you gotta have the probing interactions social intelligence is something that can be developed you do so by practice and or studying social cues an artist so adapted that study into my art of facial expressions and body language also theres many people that are not worth talking to theyre driven by petty racism and bias if you should like could talk to you text only do not have mic set up

feel worse now that tried to fix my diet exercise sleep etc and it still didnt help with depression,no therapist but your feelings sound very natural to me people prescribe exercise think because it releases those feel good hormones that depressed people are severely lacking and think its difficult to have healthy mind in an unhealthy body but what happens if someone is working out and is eating well and its had zero impact on their mood its like being healthier makes the depression worse cause you have too much energy to escape the pain in your sleep lol feel you do think you should continue to exercise and eat well though know its frustrating that the only advice lot of people and doctors can give is to exercise eat better and sleep well but those things do objectively matter if improving those things alone didnt solve your problem then that doesnt mean that those things dont matter it just means theres more than one condition you have to meet before you can improve and certain that improved physical health is one of them so dont abandon it realize how difficult that is when there are days when you can hardly find the willpower to get out of bed but hope you never stop fighting the good fight even if it gets the better of you at times sorry not smarter so cant offer you any solutions but feel you brother and really hope things get better for you barely holding on myself but trying dont try to deal with this alone id try talking to pro really lonely but im lucky that have couple people can talk to if you arent as lucky as me and dont have family member or friend to talk to then think pro is especially good idea theres groups and chat rooms and forums and stuff like here that you can go to as well hell you can vent to me too if you want
lost and exhausted,think you are giving everything way too much thought and not what really needs it life is hard and everyone should be trying their best yo make everything better but many times people get in the same position you are they dont know what to do or what to think get lot of hate for my thinking but believe you have everything it takes to make it all better it doesnt matter what you see in the news who are you related to or who is the president what matters is you doing everything you can do for yourself like the fate of the whole world was your responsibility only it might seem too big but everything else is way too boring and meaningless dont know if getting my point across but look things may not be working out right now but if you try to solve one thing at time and try to be productive and efficient about it and make realistic plan for it then things workout

just need some help,try not to hate them for not understanding no one is going to get where youre coming from unless theyve been through depression themselves you dont want to let what youre going through to permanently and unnecessarily burn bridges for something thats sort of temporary issue know you dont want to tell them about your situation but think you should tell the ones that are pissing you off that youve got some shit going on that you need to deal with and to give you some space of course thats not guaranteed to preserve any relationships but its better than blowing up on anyone you mentioned that friends and family are part of what pulled you out of your hole before so try not to tell everyone to fuck off think it would be incredibly helpful to tell someone about your situation assuming someone already knows whats up if someone else helped pulled you out of it before but if not then think talking to pro would be of great help to you this has happened before so its probably going to be an ongoing issue for you and pro can help give you tools to manage this throughout your life versus something to help you get through this moment although its important to also have those things to help you in the moment there are groups chat rooms forums ect like this that you can talk to other people about this too you can even vent at me if you want wouldnt try to deal with this on your own keep fighting man in lot of pain too but trying
years ago tomorrow almost died,theres nothing wrong with rambling just let it out think theres lot of therapeutic value in putting your thoughts and feelings into words even when it doesnt entirely make sense so keep it up keep putting out there either in here or in journal or something sorry that this event happened to you and that its anniversary still hurts you like you this its ok that it still harms you like this there is no deadline for healing and theres no shame in feeling the way that you do if you arent already talking to pro like therapist or psychiatrist then hope that you do think that they can really help you heal from this hope you and your husband have long happy marriage too and whatever you do hope things get better for you really do

using little humor to stop from sliding back down into depression,afraid depression has just two modes depressed and more depressed its an illness and feeling down is the biggest symptom but that doesnt mean you are always down you have to recognize which feeling is yours and which is the illness humor is great way to get past what you are feeling unfortunately for me my preference is for really dark humor for example theres reason we dont make jokes about the jones town massacre the punchline is too long thats what gets me through the day at times

in need of adulty wisdom on losing good friends,dont listen to me bc have no friends left but heres what picking up because of my own struggles with interpersonal relating and adhd over analysis remember dance like no ones watching except in high school they literally arent no one pays much attention to anything but their own thoughts skewed perception sad for humanity but good for you if you are ruminating on small perceived chsnges slights issues quite often no one else is giving it any mind at all so if you put the thought aside as well you may find that no one thinks its true anymore perception bias and fixation are powerful subtle liars rejection sensitivity even the slightest tinge of trouble and we internally go to red alert run from pain mode it just means we have huge hearts and sense lot of the world and its moods like counselor troi we simply have to learn to recognize and flex that muscle intentionally instead of reflexively if any of this connects with you happy to discuss further my quick litmus is will this matter at all in week then maybe just dont let it matter now either letting go isnt easy but it can certainly be honed see mindfulness meditation zen
planning to tell the first person about my mental health tomorrow dont know what to do,all you have to say is think have depression feel numb but am really scared and dont know what to do being open about depression is scary because you never know how they are going to respond but remember this depression is more common than you think most people have either experienced it or someone they love has your teacher is really good choice as the first person to tell as he or she probably has some level of training and can connect you with resources who can guide you to getting the help support acceptance that you need youve got this if you get scared think about how you would respond if one of your friends told you that they were struggling with depression you would want to help them you wouldnt think any less of them or blame them or downplay it my biggest fear when told someone was theyll think that weak or not grateful for what have or they will take it personally or they will think about me differently but none of that happened my friend was supportive and she listened she asked if there was anything she could do and she told me that she was always there to talk to and then we talked about something else it made me feel accepted worst case if you feel like you dont get the level of support you wanted from your teacher try the school counselor friend different teacher etc youre taking big step but its in the right direction

suicide is my best option,were all struggling here friend have had severe depression and anxiety for over years it gets better have been admitted to hospital for suicide before ve lost many friends and family members to it the one thing have learned there is always another option find keeping myself busy helps sometimes you have to step back and take look at yourself your life and your surroundings and make positive changes your friends have opinions like that because they dont understand but that doesnt invalidate your feelings keep trying life has ups and downs but the good times make it all worth it there is always another way
urgent situation with long distance friend,hi there im so sorry your friend is in such bad spot the first thing recommend to everybody is support groups some of which are also available to minors and dont need parental consent id recommend calling the nami national alliance on mental illness national helpline at to find youth resources near your friend you can call the national helpline or feel free to call the nami chicago helpline at know we have some queer folks and certainly allies on the other end perhaps there are also trans queer support communities online that he could find without his parents finding out but of course know that this might feel unsafe if parents are checking computers think looking into legal emancipation stuff is good as well beyond that though just want to say that have trans and queer friends and am so glad they survived their households growing up please tell your friend that he is brave and that it gets better there are so so many people who will pour out love and support to your friend in his life best
had to close the window today,think you should tell your doctor always smoke regularly and only sometimes really get into my head no one is more vicious to me about me than me when high gets me the wrong way it doesnt happen often but it gets dark dont think quitting is the only answer your head will take you there regardless think somethings just trigger things more than others
about university,youre right its okay to fail never fear failure but fear not trying again take the semester again and just be truthful about it if someone asks you will be alright honey
how do go about getting diagnosis without family doctor in canada,canadian female here dperessed since the age of family also very toxic and unsupportive when reached out telling doctor about my depression for the first time last year was terrible cried he was bit condescending and hated every minute of it but it probably saved my life and really wish had done it years earlier do yourself favour and go to walk in clinic it can be any doctor doesnt have to be your family doctor specifically they will refer you to community therapy services in your area its free live with my parents and they dont know go to therapy twice month and frankly they forfeited the right to get out there and get the therapy you deserve screw everyone else its not their depression its yours and one more thing diagnosis may take some time once therapist has been working with you for while or after screening they may refer you to psychiatrist they are the ones that make official diagnoses and prescribe medication like antidepressants know someone who got diagnosis and prescription the same day they started therapy for me it took couple of weeks and few sessions of therapy first its journey and it can look different depending on the person dont panic if you keep pushing and go after the help you need youll pull through good luck
my depressions twisted logic makes too much sense,feel like you just described my life had zero self worth and absolutely hated myself it got to the point where the only thing that brought me any joy was planning how was going to kill myself its gotten better over the past few years but it took long time all of these problems seem so suffocating and overwhelming that it seems like you will never be able to dig yourself out from underneath them one thing my therapist did that helped me out was to take index cards and write out all the things either hate about myself or negatively impact my self image and lay them all out on table from there take out all of the things that are out of my control like past relationships or experiences and instead focus on the things that can now instead of this giant cloud hanging over my head ve got it down to or things laid out in front that all seemed manageable from there picked the easiest thing could fix and started working on that they were small incremental changes but each step gave me sense of accomplishment that motivated me to work towards the next goal mental rehabilitation is very similar to physical rehabilitation if you get in car accident and break both your legs they arent just going to get better in there own they need time to heal then they need to excersiced and in serious cases you may need to relearn how to walk its the same for your brain it takes work but each step gets progressively easier depression is never going to go away ve been out of the darkest parts of it for few years but it still hits me occasionally and still get anxiety attacks but throughout this process ve developed different coping mechanisms so they arent as debilitating as they used to be hope you can make any sense out of my ramblings and wish you the best man

can we talk about the roro chan incident,have strong gut so did watch the video audio just now it makes me sad to know child basically thought she would become legendary for committing suicide it shows she was naive and depressed she never became legendary just another sad and unfortunate statistic and to all those who encouraged her to do it are low life bullies she had long life to live unfortunately she ended it early for nothing may she rest in peace

read few things that had helped me hope this helps you with any situation you are going through,thanks for the uplifting words appreciate your efforts in helping others
my mum has depression aswell as anxiety any advice,your intentions are admirable but there is something that doesnt require so much creativity and has good results theres bit of science behind it as well if you hug someone after twenty seconds your brain will begin to release endorphins when she is feeling down just give her prolonged hug even if you are not depressed it can mean lot to anyone on more serious note your mother has an illness good intentions wont substitute for proper medical care help her with appointments and medication and she will do better
friendly reminder that you need to hear today,prove it dont need more and more platitudes
depression due to adhd is it curable,depression is treatable therapy sometimes meds not always needed depression can be chronic but thats not always the case lot of people has one crisis and never again since yours is related to your adhd think that if you treat both things its probable that it wont come back the therapy will help you to deal with your adhd and all the bad feelings that you are feeling it will take time but it will really good for you wish you the best
putting trust into people,exactly man what you said proved what feared would happen when my parents saw the cuts on my arms they begged me to tell them my problems refused because could not put the burden on them and be around them knowing that they knew what was going through my mind all the time sorry for what happened to you it honestly so hard to put trust in anybody
trying to help my friend and be understanding,if you are trying to help him then this about him not your feelings do not require him to answer am sure he wont like that pressure am exactly the same ignore texts smss and even dont pick up the phone when am stressed out cant take the social pressure of having to react reply best you can do for him not require him to answer perhaps dont ask questions or only simple yes no questions ie how are you is very easy question that is very hard to answer by someone who is very depressed totally ignore such question on the other hand you can say something like am going for walk youre welcome to join me if you want is not question will probably be ignored too but will almost certainly make him feel less lonely and less depressed knowing you are there for him
depression and mess,hi something ve found to be really helpful when dealing with mess is to attach tasks on to things that do regularly so for example if getting up to make something to eat know that ll be going in the kitchen so before go ll look around my room and see if can find any dirty dishes that have been sitting around for awhile and take them with me to the kitchen and put them in the sink depending on how bad my depression is that day may only have enough energy to do just that but at least have few less dishes festering in my room when eventually do have the energy to wash them its lot easier since theyre all in the sink but if still in particular low mood than just tell myself that each time go in the kitchen going to wash at least thing before leave seriously it could be just spoon but thats still one less dish in the sink and usually once start doing something can sometimes get into mode where end up washing dishes before leave which is even better going to the bathroom before you leave look around and see is there anything you put back in its place or wipe down before you leave since youre already in there anyway even if its just sweeping all the bobby pins that are on the counter into the drawer its still something and now you dont have bobby pins on the counter anymore for your particular situation you mentioned your living room is quite messy so my advice would be the next time you pass by walk through it just grab or things literally anything and if it has proper home take it there or if its trash through it away obviously this depends on how often you pass by it but by doing this youre slowly starting the process of chipping away at this seemingly overwhelming mess have energy to pick up few more items great but if not than at least you or less things cluttering your living room than you did before similarly if you or your sister or leaving to go somewhere or coming back from somewhere assuming you have to walk through your living room to get to the door you could do the same thing where you just pick up few items and only focus on putting away or throwing away those things like this method lot because it takes the pressure off of me feeling like have to do absolutely everything all in one day or feel stressed out by the amount of work know going to have to do in order to get things back to clean and tidy state the important thing to remember throughout all of this is that your mess didnt accumulate in day it accumulated over long period of time and as such will take some time to clean up and put things back the way they were before the mess anyways hope this helped you little and youre able to tackle your living room without feeling so overwhelmed

should end everything,hi am and have been fighting depression and anxiety for over years since most of that time my life was barely livable did not end it all because just could not go through with it you mentioned you have shopping addiction and it doesnt make you feel better do you by any chance suffer from any other type of addiction discovered with myself that all this time had horrible addiction that never figured was an addiction and it caused most of the problems in my life once confronted and understood my addiction things started to get better just thought hope you get better
hearing voices and thinking about going to the hospital,its definitely where you need to be at its worst my depression turned into full blown psychotic episode was hearing voices and was sure there were two other people with me before an ambulance had to be called had to be and on hour hold if you go voluntarily you will have more say as to how long you stay you can have your meds adjusted or changed which was what needed

shouldnt be happy if love myself,put black white you could say that if not love yourself not happy but that doesnt mean if love oneself happy no its just prerequisite personally believe that happiness has to do with relationships if you have lot of good friends that you can spend quality time with and have fun then you will have many happy moments in order to get lot of good friends you need to love yourself or at least not hate yourself if you have good life that is independent then people will like to be part of that life for example person that look up to is guy years older than me who proved himself in life he has been in the marines and then started company that ran well under his leadership lately he volunteered to help other people he became my buddy he has the strength to keep himself fit by training lot takes care of his family has more friends then he has time for so yeah after he stopped being my buddy we lost contact but he sure as hell could have had me as dedicated friend and no not in gay way hes not my type at all lets call him ugly purely based on personality think that what is important here for me is that he does not need me in any way if you can be that kind of person you will find people want to stick around and some will turn into good friends adding to the value of your social circles and thus attracting even more people
forgot how to make friends,how old are the kids many people at your stage of life are very focused on their family kids often belong to activities playgroups beginning sports teams other families are involved in that you can make friends there in addition to focusing on your kids which you should be doing best of luck with getting clean and sober good on ya

hard to admit it even to myself,can think of some reasons why but cant sort them out for you you could think that you did nothing to deserve help and with letting it exist you would do the first step for help you heard often that you make big deal out of nothing and you feel like this could be the case even though it isnt you are scared of working on your depression because its more or less the big unknown and agreeing on its existence would only make it real you are embarrased about it because others had worse times and seemingly arent depressed this is just me giving options cant tell you wich one it is or maybe even multiple of it

help early mornings and scared ll lose my job,hey have fear of missing class or other events that require getting up early since insomnia doesnt allow me to sleep until am single so its just me in my bed what do is set alarms and snooze them until an hour before having to leave it just helps me become half asleep know having fitbit can wake you by the watch vibrating but am not sure if everyone feels it maybe find an alarm that can be tucked under your pillow and vibrates to wake you good luck also take deep breaths and try to relax your heart rhythm everything will be okay

how can motivate myself to study when dont care that much and my brain is shit,don have great advice for studying when depressed because know it hard when you re in the thick of it except maybe take it in slow chunks and commit to just minutes if that feels doable find that once start something usually get some momentum and can keep going it the starting point that is biggest hurdle so trick my stupid reptilian brain just change into your gym clothes and if you still don want to go you don have to just start the shower and if you still don feel like showering you can turn it off sounds silly but works well for lot of scenarios when overwhelmed and paralyzed if it helps struggled with major depressive disorder anxiety and substance abuse through my entire twenties pretty much and it took me years to finish my degree and figure out what wanted to be lot of false starts and failed classes but ironically made more progress when learned to forgive myself stop beating myself up and acknowledge myself for the small accomplishments instead of bullying myself and ruminating on my failures finished did some internships and now have full career and the hour week does suck sometimes but so grateful to have made it and be mentally ok that it bearable so try not to lose hope or give up and know that the hopeless feelings and uncertainty about the future is largely symptom and not truth about you or your future it ok to take time to figure out your life path are you working with therapist or doctor on your immediate mental health or doing things to try and tackle it it hard to handle the big stuff when you re this down and it not your fault depression makes us project into the future that everything will always be this hard hopeless and it just makes it harder to look at what right in front of you

how do you know if you have depression,am not professional but you should see your doctor about this everyone gets little blue once in while maybe for few days everyone gets stressed out untill the stressor is gone or it just passes but feeling this way consistently for weeks at the time to the severity that it affects sleep relations school work quality of life etc repeatedly over the course of several months suggests that something more serious than just being stressed out about an exam is going on

anyone else experience pill phobia after suicide attempt,understand this had similar experience and have trouble with pills now my experience wasnt as serious as your attempt but it does have similar after effects as long term sufferer of depression and anxiety ve always been on medication however few years back took an overdose of my medication it wasnt necessarily suicide attempt it was more just way of wanting so feel something other than what was feeling at that current time hoping that the overdose would at least put me to sleep for long while ended up in hospital because of it but ever since that day ve struggled to take medication can no longer take the certain type of medication had taken on the day of the overdose because it literally makes me heave and feel so nauseous from it even tried halfing my doses hoping that wouldnt experience these awful side effects but it doesnt make difference even the sight of medication makes me feel like going to vomit its like constant feeling of having something press against my gag reflex ve spoken to specialist mental health doctor and he says that its psychological from the overdose even if not actively thinking about the overdose when see medication subconsciously its still in my mind thus causing physical symptoms of heaving and feeling severe nausea this last couple of weeks ve tried really hard to take my prescribed medication ve suffered the nauseating effects and sickness but ve noticed the effects reducing the longer keep up the routine of taking the medication daily decided to take the pills right before bed time so could try to sleep through the effects instead of suffer them throughout the day its helped little but now days into forgetting to take my meds so now too scared to take them again because dont want to face the bad side effects again

struggling to help my girlfriend of years,everyone deals and struggles with these things differently so my own opinion on your personal matter is not necessarily the right one but am in similar situation the difference am the depressed so in relationship of years first and foremost what matters is you are doing your best no one should ever fault you for trying but the reality is you can be her therapist she needs to decide to see one on her own but that also doesn mean the seeing professional will actually fix everything it won the steps to getting better all lie in her not you but her what you can do is be her rock be supportive and my inkling is that she does still want to live with you and she does want the trip but her mind is telling her no because for whatever reason depression is this voice taking over her head that keeps saying no you don deserve that or you re not good enough sometimes the voice is so strong that you can even stand being around those you love it like your scared to be loved and she is pushing away because of that so while in this moment she may feel compelled to pull away from you you need to remind her that what she is feeling now isn permanent let her no its real and valid but that you will always be there to support her sometimes just having that constant is enough to bring someone back to the here and now and you know what try expressing to her how her pain also hurts you don blame her obviously but sometimes real sincere empathy can be an eye opener hope this helps you even just bit
how do ask for help when can even do anything,try going to psychologist first should explain to you why he thinks or not if you should go to psychiatrist for farmacological recommendation if you visit any of those two make sure to mention the subtances issues that is an important part of choosing the right treatment profesionales must work this way if you dont want to take drugs then is their job to find another way to help you and that way must be accompanied with therapy you already make the first step asking for advice hope you are able to make the next one

feeling extremely unmotivated and wanting to not live anymore,feel this way lot including right now but still here and youre still here and youve made it this far few things that have helped me recently per my therapist if youre feeling unmotivated set an alarm for certain time every day that you use to get things done mine for instance is pm in which use that hour to do things ve been putting off work on some art go for bike ride etc if you stick to it it forces sort of schedule and allows you to force yourself not to procrastinate and can motivate you to even keep working past the hour mark lot of the time starting is the hardest part ask for help from those you trust maybe reach out to your boyfriend and let them know whats going on dont be afraid to ask for help people who love you will want you to help but dont forget to reach out to them about the good things too try to remember that this is just one point in time albeit very difficult one thanks coronavirus things are stagnant the political climate is chaotic and the world seems to be on fire but it wont always be things change and there is still good happening dont feel guilty for what youre feeling being unmotivated can lead to guilt for not being as productive but sometimes you have to let yourself relax as stated above this is but one moment in your life let yourself feel and learn more about yourself hope this helps at least little bit hang in there

got told that don know what depression is,dear dont worry about people who told you that you dont know about depression forget about them and their stupid talk even my family act like dont know anything and am pretending to be depressed get really mad at their accusations like am lazy and smart but am acting up because eat and sleep watching shows this year am just dealing with lot of problems and currently not working and damaged emotionally with no confidence that am not sure that can get myself to work if ever pass interviews an emotional eater so whenever get depressed just do binge eating or stay hungry for hours and sleeping long hours or short disturbed sleep an introvert hypersensitive and tend to do things at my pace not slow or fast but people tell lazy and see me as worthless which brings my confidence down people just like to tear my image and make me incapacitated this is really heartbreaking for me when tell about my feelings of sadness it is bullshit and lies and am just acting up to escape from doing house chores do it when my dark moods disappear but when they feel sad for nonsensical things they need all the pity and comfort in the world it hurts because have suffered like anything in childhood and also now in adulthood the worst part is my family know me closely more than anyone in the world but still they are the only ones who invalidate my feelings and emotions and hurt me like anything have had suicidal thoughts from as early in childhood but they think that am just scaring them or bluffing and seeking attention they are the ones who are toxic to me driving me mad know how close have been to do it and would have been done with it by overdose like you but promised one person who is my family that will not act upon it so only am struggling to live to keep my promise please try to get good therapist and leave people who talk nonsense please please dont ever think of taking such drastic steps hold on for better times
feeling worthless,hey know replying late but you can talk to me to feel better kind of seem to relate how you think hope youre doing better now
am in my th year of an education degree and the idea of teaching for the rest of my life makes me sick to my stomach,so ve taught not music but english so some of your worries have merit and others not so much few things first you don have to constantly plan classes the way people think lot of resources are usually online of lesson plans other people have made in the past also if you save all your own lesson plans well you just reuse them on future classes so it not as crazy at it may seem on that front also usually you are teaching the same classes over and over so it not like your planning hours of classes if you teach two classes four times day well that two one hour lesson plans you just repeat it four times next thing in this day and age for lot of jobs it doesn matter what your degree is in bet you think have an english degree because taught english nope have science degree never actually used it in my field for job lot of jobs out there just require degree they often don even care what it from would say give music teaching chance though you might like it and don stress you can always quit and do something else the last thing want to stress is you don just have music degree half of that is an educational degree right well guess what there are lot of jobs in education maybe you decide you don want to be music teacher you can probably do more of the administration side of schools of you don want to deal with kids all day there so many options open to you don fret too much let me give you some examples of shit you could do going to assume you re american since much of reddit is but some of these may differ if you re not but here we go you could get your tefl and teach english to chinese kids abroad just need degree for most places you could get corporate job that just wants bachelors lot of places don care where it from just that you have one you can join the military as an officer since you ll have degree hell you could join the marine corps band yes that thing it doesn matter what your degree is in to become an officer just that you have one you could retire with great benefits in years you could join the administration side of school and not do lesson plans and stuff every day you could do private music lessons where your only focused on few kids so it not as overwhelming you could keep going to school get masters degree in different but related field maybe one more focused on the educational aspect and become guidance counselor mean there are so many options here
if were to disappear no one would notice care,sorry you feel like that and honestly can understand where youre coming from sometimes when think about my friends about how they ignore me if they would even notice if was gone if they were ever my friends so does having friends or not make any difference maybe the feeling of loneliness comes from the inside not outside factors as the phrase alone in crowd indicates have to sometimes kick myself to reach out even tough slightly sad or bitter that they dont notice me first it would be harder to be depressed and proud honestly but you are probably more shy than me in that case would say to work on your confidence think depression and anxiety is labeled as one big thing that completely incapacitates us which may not always be the case think it could be broken up to smaller bites confidence habits hormones environment childhood genes and working with smaller pieces is much more manageable

lonely and burden to everyone,hey you aren alone know it may feel like you are but you aren ve go through phases of thinking like this about myself but it not true about me or you your value is not defined by the way others treat you and sure most people don hate you most people are too busy worrying about whether people hate them to give that much energy to other people sometimes when we tell ourselves things like burden it becomes self fulfilling prophecy people who view themselves as burdens tend to project lot of the negativity outwards making it harder to hold onto relationships that isn judgement on character or worth just stating that people want to be around confident happy people being happy is process and it takes time to truly accept yourself but that doesn mean you shouldn try challenge you to list things youre grateful for every morning and tell yourself great job when you do something well this can be as simple as for getting out of bed when you feel too tired to good luck wish you all the best

is clinical diagnosis worth it,would say not the label is easily applied it is how providers get paid however the label is not relevant or weighted in any way that is useful to treatment options which are all generally underwhelming and rarely effective thought it was important to have an official diagnosis regret doing so for many reasons had anything worked maybe feel differently when you are desperate the label diagnosis seems promising it is meaningless and offers not salvation in itself recommend support groups more then anything pay out of pocket for therpists if possible if you want to try meds you will have diagnosis snd then pick up the candy shortly there after meds are effective only about of the time if you are not struggling in devastating ways it is not something recommend

is it lifelong disease,maybe this helps maybe it doesnt had this long story typed out but insted ill summarize most of my life has been struggle cant take anti depressants or even seek therapy because of my job the most important things did for myself was committing to things even when it wasnt always perfect actually iv never gotten even close to doing anything perfectly or the way seen it in my mind except for one thing anyway whatever it is in your life dont beat yourself you are your toughest critic if missed few days of the gym in row feel like just saying fuck it if messed things up at work get home and just want to quit but if you do that you never get better so then actually tried to commit to giving things some amount of effort more than the minimum and had setbacks had and still have more bad days than good but man those wins those really good days where had it all together knew exactly what was doing completely in control that feeling is the best thing in the world and fuel to keep trying someday ll find enough motivation to try as hard as can at something and see what im really capable of but in any case you said any little trigger can send you into spiral try to look for solution to problems and even if the best option sucks thats all there is and move on know way easyer said than done but once you start it gets easyer good luck out there keep your head up

had full breakdown over computer part,struggle with the same kind of feelings can make mistakes and think why did just mess that up it was so easy should just give up mistakes can really set me back because feel that shouldn be making any but the reality is that will always make mistakes and thats okay not stupid because made mistake applying the thermal paste which is pretty annoying process tbh not stupid because didn do something right that should have done right these should haves come from our upbringing we are told to not make mistakes we are told to fix it ourselves we are told to not share our feelings because of all this many people never learn to be compassionate with themself we feel that doing so is sign of weakness the first step to getting over this is fully accepting yourself fully accept the fact that you feel this way fully accept that you made mistake fully accept that you also think it stupid to make mistake fully take in these feelings for what they are because quite simply they are just feelings they will pass if we simply acknowledge them and understand they are temporary it is important to note that accepting yourself doesn mean to not grow it just means to not fight your own natural feelings from coming up inside you sincerely suggest reading the book radical acceptance it explains all this much more clearly also strongly suggest you start simple journal where you write of your successes every day the goal isn to have some crazy successes the goal is to start giving yourself credit for the small wins in your day example shared my frustration on reddit today successfully shared my feelings on reddit and am successfully caring for my wellbeing updated my computer it may have been bumpy but am successfully continuing my hobby and successfully creatively expressing myself successfully spent time writing my successes for the day you want to start the slow process of shifting your thoughts to new landscape this takes gradual change over long periods of time this is why suggest journal to begin this habit and suggest that book as it covers the concept of accepting yourself
depressed because daughter wont repay me,your creation is weird phrasing she is human being she is the sum of her experiences and relationships she does not owe you anything simply because you are her creator she does however owe you because you loaned her when you loaned her the money was it clear to her that it was loan what was the plan for repayment if there wasnt one before draw one up now and bring it to her tell her its this or small claims court eta because saw your other reply to commenter if her hours are cut then make it percentage based repayment like send me of your paycheck at the end of the month or for every you earn you should send me bring her an actionable plan be the example for how to deal with something like debt

to all the people who have gotten much better than before what did you do,used to be model first child always kind always complying always putting others in front suffered from anxiety and partial depression in the end now turned my life to the better got rid most of this issues and overcame this problem ba doing this turning egoistic sounds pretty daring but since putting my priorities and my needs and my true wishes always first got out of this hole pretty fast and could regain my life back so it doesnt feel like its been handled by someone else anymore constantly said no when didnt feel like doing someone favor it takes some time for the mindset change but say human ruins its own life by not listening to oneself properly

question for those who suffer with depression and have kids,sorry dont have kids so maybe you will disregard this and please know this is the opinion of someone who is childfree and purposely would never choose to have child partly because of passing down my mental illness just thought as someone with severe depression could weigh in your husband should definitely get second opinion and that first psychiatrist needs to be reported would suggest you one hundred percent not add children to situation like this until he is on more even keel adding baby does not help someones depression get better especially if he is not currently being helped professionally and it will put strain on an already difficult part of his life and yours plus you are going to be full time with baby so if you are also caring for him you will double the workload on your own shoulders so your mental health needs to be looked after too and if there is any post partum depression you might also need support that your partner might not be able to give dont mean this to be cruel or to upset you and not saying never have kids this is only my opinion as someone who suffers from the inherited effects of depression that quite few people in my family have my moms own untreated mental health issues prevented her from caring for myself and my siblings mental health issues depression can potentially harm your husbands life or the babys and will worsen without help if your husband cant get out of bed he cant help with childcare and you and baby both deserve someone who can help with that plus if hes good man hell want to help and might feel like he failed if he cant please just get him help first wish the best of luck to you both and to your future baby

what to do if nothing is enjoyable anymore,life is like that its fact that everything you experience the first times will have the biggest dopamine rush the more you do that thing the less dopamine you produce you sound young and if you have been diagnosed as depressive and you are experiencing any of the more debilitating symptoms of the disease then find therapist and get help other than that like to think though my feelings and try to use my knowledge of the inner workings of the mind to come to terms with the mood am feeling if that makes sense like know they found that my anxiety and depressive thoughts actually start as the chemical release in the brain only after the release does my mind come up with the reasoning for the feeling used to attribute my anxiety to the daily news my wife made weird look so she must hate me my kid is being bad etc had to learn none of the thoughts that think are the cause of depression are really the cause it is just my mind creating an excuse for the chemical that is off balance it took me long time to learn this and lived through some really tough times as far as feeling numb ignore it diet exercise and get out and chat with people do stuff even if you are numb go for long walks in nature because there is proof that increases dopamine relaxes you and that will make you less numb fake smiles at strangers stand taller as stupid as it sounds there is solid proof these little things can have an effect

addressing depression in indian society,hi guys great job to start an american female so not exactly your target audience that being said really liked how you gave examples of common misconceptions people make and comments one might hear if they do express their emotions what someone might hear if they are suffering from depression also liked at the end explaining how to help and what help is available ve personally noticed shift in society here in america concerning mental health it was once common place to think person was crazy if they went to therapy with millennials aging into adulthood weve brought the belief that therapy is much like going to the doctor once year for physical necessary for good health and completely normal really hope this continues to be accepted here and the normalization continues to spread to india and the rest of the world lovely video
